<h3><a name="Pref" id="Pref"></a>PREFACE.</h3>

<p>It is a truism that the history of building is the
history of the civilized world, for of all the arts
practised by man, there is none which conveys to
us a clearer conception of the religion, history, manners,
customs, ideals and follies of past ages, than the art of
building. This applies in a special sense to cathedrals
and churches, which glorious relics reflect and perpetuate
the noble aim, the delicate thought, the refined
and exquisite taste, the patient and painstaking toil
which have been expended upon them by the devout
and earnest craftsmen of the past.</p>

<p>There are very few of our ancient churches in village,
town or city which do not offer some feature of interest
to the visitor, and in the absence of anything more
important, there is sure to be some door, window, font,
screen, or other detail which will amply repay him for
the small amount of time spent in seeing it.</p>

<p>The aim of the author of this little volume has been
to indicate the symbolism and meaning attaching to the
various portions of our churches and cathedrals, and to
endeavour briefly to describe, in language as simple as
the subject will allow, the various styles of ecclesiastical
architecture with their distinctive characteristics in such
a way as will enable the reader to assign each portion
and detail of a church to its respective period with an
approximate degree of accuracy.</p>

<p>He does not claim to be original, but endeavours to
be useful and interesting. The best authorities have
been consulted and freely drawn upon, but with the
object in view of writing a book at once thus useful and
interesting, no attempt has been made to deal with the
subject in a strictly architectural, or a purely scientific
manner.</p>
<p>Weymouth, 1906.</p>

<h3><a name="Dedic" id="Dedic"></a>DEDICATION.</h3>

<p>To all those who love old buildings&mdash;cathedrals,
abbeys, and village churches, which breathe the
spirit of an age with which we have entirely
broken&mdash;and who would fain hand down to posterity,
unmutilated, the great building achievements of our forefathers,
which we, with all our science, wealth, and
means of curtailing labour, can no more imitate than
we can reproduce the language of a Chaucer or a Shakespeare;
this book is respectfully dedicated.</p>

<h2><span class="wide">OUR HOMELAND CHURCHES<br />
AND<br />
HOW TO STUDY THEM.</span></h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3><a name="Intro" id="Intro"></a>INTRODUCTION.</h3>

<p>However much we may admire, considered purely
as art, the Pagan temples of the Greeks and
Romans, we must confess that they are lacking
in those high ideals and those sustained and inspired
motives which seem to penetrate and permeate the
buildings and churches of the Christian era. Perfect as
is Greek art within its somewhat narrow limits, it is,
nevertheless, cold, precise and lifeless. The Gothic
buildings on the contrary are pregnant with the very
spirit of life.</p>

<p>Prompted by a deep and fervent faith in their religion,
the Gothic builders and sculptors unconsciously wove
into the humblest of their architectural enrichments some
portion of their daily life and personality. The slave-built
temples of the Greeks offered no scope for the
exercise of individual expression&mdash;such, in fact, would
have been strongly resented&mdash;whereas the early Christian
craftsman, revelling in his freedom, seized every opportunity
of expressing in his work his joy, fear and hope
of immortality.</p>

<p>This is made apparent in the study of an old church,
whereof every portion&mdash;door, window, bench-end,
carving, gargoyle&mdash;has hidden about it some suggestion of
beautiful thought, or some distinct and appropriate symbolism.
The fact that symbolism underlies almost every<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
such indication of medi&aelig;val thought is made abundantly
manifest in the study of medi&aelig;val literature. Open any
12th century treatise on morals, science or history, and
you become aware of the fact at once.<a name="img2" id="img2"></a></p>

<p>The main-spring
of this symbolism, of all Christian symbolism, turns on
the parabolic meaning in the scheme of Creation. The
early writers were far less concerned with recording the
plain objective facts of history, than in pursuing the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
allegory and the love of the marvellous, and showing all
those characteristics of what we now term an unscientific
attitude of mind.</p>

<p>In its widest sense, symbolism means the expression
of belief, and if we would interpret history aright, we
must grasp the fact that the key to the character and
disposition of peoples of all ages lies in the knowledge of
their beliefs; for out of the beliefs of one age most surely
grow the beliefs of its successors, and in no work of man's
hand are the beliefs held by various peoples in past ages
more clearly defined than in our cathedrals and churches,
which noble buildings in every civilized country indicate
principles as well as facts, influences as well as results;
and while presenting the finest materials for &aelig;sthetic
study, are no less useful as indicating the psychological
peculiarities of those builders of old to whose condition
they bear witness.</p>

<p>In our grand specimens of ecclesiastical architecture,
we may read the world's later history, and to-day they
breathe the sombre reverential influence of a faith
which sought to satisfy itself with the visible symbolizing
of those half-poetical, half-superstitious conceptions with
which the religion of the Middle Ages was so deeply
imbued.</p>

<p>An early development of decorative symbolic art,
known as Celtic, of which we have examples on old Irish
crosses, and particularly on illuminated MSS. was wrought
by the Christian monks of the 7th and 8th centuries, but
what is generally understood as Christian symbolic art
had its finest development about the 13th century. Gothic
art is essentially symbolic and in many instances, its
individual forms have specific significance. Thus the
common equilateral triangle was used to symbolize the
Holy Trinity, as are the two entwined triangles. Other
symbols employed at this period setting forth the mystery
of the Unity of the Trinity, without beginning and without
end, are three interlaced circles, and a very curious one
is that in which three faces are so combined as to form
an ornamental figure. Baptism under the immediate
sanction of the Divine Trinity was represented by three<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
fishes placed together in the form of a triangle.<a name="img3" id="img3"></a></p>

So numerous, indeed were such Christian symbols after the
9th century that a mere enumeration of them would
occupy considerable space. Every trefoil symbolized the
Holy Trinity; every quatrefoil the four Evangelists;
every cross the Crucifixion, or the martyrdom of some
saint; and in Gothic ornament and decoration, we find
the Chalice, the Crown of Thorns, the Dice, the Sop, the
Hammer and Nails, the Flagellum and other symbols
of our Lord's Passion.</p>

<p>Although presenting the same characteristics in their
external design, our town and village churches are very
various. The simplest form, and the one most commonly
found, is that of a nave and chancel, with a tower at the
west end; to which plan may be added aisles and transepts,
the latter often being wrongly called "cross-aisles."
When the walls of the nave above the arcade
rise above those of the aisles and are pierced with windows,
the upper portion is called the clerestory, the meaning of
which word is not free from obscurity; it seems probable
that it indicates the clear story&mdash;the story which rises
clear of the nave and aisles. In large buildings, they
are important both for utility and beauty, but in small
and early churches, they are of less importance.</p>

<p>It is a well-known fact that the chancel and nave of
a church generally stand east and west. This arrangement,
called the orientation, is symbolic of the
teaching that to the east we are to look for assistance
and protection against the power of our enemy, and that
as we pray we may look for the day-spring, symbolized
to us in the rising sun that sheds light and warmth all
over the earth.</p>

<p>The public entrance to a church is generally at the west
end (the priest usually had a door in the chancel for his
own use). Through this door we enter the house of
prayer, for as in the east we see the emblem of the Lord
of Life and Light, so the west represents the seat of
darkness and of the powers of evil.</p>

<p>The earliest porches were those of the early Christian
basilica churches; they were long and arcaded and were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
called "narthex." In later times, they assumed two
forms, one the projecting erection, covering the entrance
and divided into three or more doorways, and the other
a kind of covered chamber open at the end and having
small windows at the sides. These latter are generally
found on the north and south sides of the nave. Formerly,
when church government was more rigorous in
discipline than is now the case, the porch was the appointed
place for those who were under censure. Those also
who were unbaptised, or who had not yet received the
sacrament of regeneration, were not allowed beyond the
porch, not quite excluded from the church and yet not
permitted to enter fully. The porch also served as a
path of admission for all Christians into the body of the
church, so that they passed through the assembly of
penitents and catechumens, who were wont to ask the
prayers of the more highly privileged for their full restoration
or admission to the communion of the faithful.</p>

<p>With reference to our Lord's word, "I am the
Door," we frequently find the tympana of church doors,
particularly those of Norman date, adorned with representations
of events from his life, but they often also depict
the monsters, dragons and devils, that formed so strong
an article in the faith of the early Christians.</p>

<p>A more detailed account of these tympana will be
found in a following chapter.</p>

<p>Passing through the porch we enter the nave, which
word is derived from the Latin <i>navis</i>, a ship. Its symbolic
teaching is that of the Church riding triumphantly
and buoyantly on the troubled and dark waters of the
world. The first thing noticed on entering the nave is
the font, which was formerly placed outside the church,
in a separate building called the baptistery; a few of our
churches have retained these little buildings which now
form part of the churches proper.</p>

<p>The reason in early days for placing the font outside
the church was that the Christian was not admitted into
the nave until he had been baptised and confirmed, the
latter rite being administered immediately after baptism.</p>

<p>From the western door there is a clear passage through<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the centre of the nave, called the aisle, signifying the
straight and narrow way from the seat of darkness to
immortal life. On each side of this aisle are seats for
the laity, with room for standing and kneeling. The nave
was usually divided from the chancel by an open screen
of wood or stone, signifying that although the Christian
might have some insight into the mysteries of the priest's
office, at the same time these were to be partly concealed
from his view. The rood screen was so called from
the fact that the great Rood, or Crucifix, stood
above it, not always on the screen itself, but on a
separate beam, to which was often attached a rood loft
or chamber. In early days, the lessons were read from
the top of the rood screen, and in many of our churches
the stairways leading thither have been retained.<a name="img4" id="img4"></a></p>

<p>In churches where the screen has vanished, the division
of the nave from the rest of the church is plainly marked
by the chancel arch. The chancel is emblematic of the
Christian perfection, of the Church triumphant in heaven.</p>

<p>In an old church, a piscina is nearly always found in
the chancel, and here, too, were the sedilia or seats for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
the officiating clergy, the prior, sub-prior, and the
deacon, the last-named occupying the lowest seat.</p>

<p>Founders' tombs also nearly always occupy positions
in the chancel, and these tombs differ from all others in
that they form an integral part of the structure, and
could not have been added after the church was completed.</p>

<p>Another thing sometimes to be seen is the ambery,
or aumbry, a small cupboard let into the chancel wall,
in which were kept the communion vessels, the chalice,
paten, etc.</p>

<p>The great object of interest, however, in the chancel,
is the altar, which Archbishop Laud directed should be
enclosed by rails, so that although the people may draw
near, they cannot touch the holy table, but must accept
from the hands of the priest those gifts of which he is
the minister from God.</p>

<p>Altars are fully described in a following chapter, but
we may here note that the reredos, so universally found
in our cathedrals, abbeys, and in many of our churches,
forms no part of the altar, and the Court of Arches has
decided that there are no altars in the Church of England,
but only communion tables.</p>

<p>Prominent among the external enrichments of our
churches is the gargoyle, a word derived from the French,
"gargouille," which in its turn comes from the Latin
"gurgulio"&mdash;a water-spout. The earliest gargoyles are
merely orifices with a lip to shoot the water well away
from the fabric. The true gargoyle, however, was
quickly evolved from this primitive form, and consists
of two parts, the lower one forming the channel, the
upper one being the cover. The full significance of the
skill displayed by the old masons in the rare opportunity
the gargoyle afforded them of representing the dragons,
serpents, etc., in which their fancy revelled, is made
apparent when we view the futile attempts of modern
architects to introduce this feature in their churches, for
modern gargoyles are generally grotesque caricatures,
and anything but happy appendages to the buildings to
which they are attached.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>

<p>The churchyard, so pleasing an adjunct to the House
of God placed within it, is frequently approached through
a lych-gate, which word is derived from the Saxon <i>lich</i>,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
a corpse. These gates in our country churchyards are
often very picturesque little structures, and under
them the corpse at a funeral awaited the officiating
priest before being taken into the church. The churchyard
is commonly regarded as a mere dependency
of the church, and as having a history very inferior
in interest to that of the temple to which it is the
court. The truth is that many of our churchyards
have an antiquity far greater than that of the
churches, as many of them constituted the open-air
meeting-places of our Saxon forefathers long before the
erection of parish churches. In the common meeting-place
a cross was set up, either of wood or stone, to mark
and hallow the spot, and when a church was subsequently
built it was usually in the immediate vicinity of the cross,
which accounts for the fact that many churchyard
crosses are of older date than the churches themselves.</p>

<p>Wells of water are often found in old churchyards,
and as the regulations of the Saxon church required
immersion and not sprinkling, it is possible that these
were the Saxon fonts.</p>

<p>Such then is the necessarily brief attempt to describe
the main lines on which our old churches were planned,
and the motives and ideals which animated their builders,
who, being impressed with the dignity and mystery of
the works of God, made their churches symbolical of the
portions of the Christian life; the porch signifying
baptism, the nave the life militant on earth, and the
chancel the life eternal; while every little ornament,
piece of sculpture and enrichment was designed to remind
the worshippers of their faith, of its hopes, blessed
promises and rewards.</p>

<h3>EARLY BRITISH CHURCHES.</h3>

<p>In dealing with the introduction of church architecture
into our own land, the task would be much
simplified if one could state with certainty when
the first church was built on British soil. Some historians
assert that the Church of England as it is constituted
to-day dates no further back than the moment
when S. Augustine and his followers landed on the shores
of Kent in the year 596, yet one is probably justified in
assuming that a church existed in these islands for
centuries previous to the arrival of the Roman missionaries.
Unfortunately we have no records to guide us as
to the date of this earlier settlement, and the name of
the first Christian missionary to heathen Britain has still
to be discovered. "We see," says the quaint old historian,
Thomas Fuller, "the light of the word shined here,
but see not who kindled it." The first Christian building
of which we have any record was probably that erected
at Glastonbury before the year 300, but that this was the
first Christian settlement cannot be alleged with certainty.</p>

<p>There are many traditions concerning the introduction
of Christianity into Britain, some of which may probably
have some bearing on the truth, but the whole subject
is involved in considerable obscurity. One of these
numerous traditions is to the effect that the British King
Caradoc, after being taken prisoner to Rome, was allowed
to return, on condition that several members of his family
remained as hostages; and whilst serving in this capacity,
his mother, son, and daughter are stated to have become
converts to Christianity, the doctrines of which faith
they spread in their native land on their return thereto.
Another tradition is to the effect that S. Paul himself
visited Britain and laid the foundation of the Christian
faith.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a><a name="img6" id="img6"></a></span></p>

<p>We are also told by eminent church historians<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
that the father and grandfather of S. Patrick were
Christians, in which case S. Patrick himself would from
a very early age have been brought up in the tenets of
their faith. He is said to have been seized by pirates in
the Clyde and taken to the north of Ireland, and eventually
to Gaul. He was subsequently restored to his friends,
whom he wished to convert to the Christian faith, and
for this purpose his father sent him to be taught in the
schools of Tours, Auxerre and Lerins. Eventually he
was consecrated Bishop of the Irish and organized an
efficient ecclesiastical system in Ireland.</p>

<p>Before the coming of the Anglo-Saxons the church
seems to have established a firm hold on the people, who
held tenaciously to their possessions, both secular and
religious, which were only wrested from them after a
severe struggle. Their enthusiastic love of Christianity
led them to make a heroic defence of the churches,
rather than see them fall into the hands of the heathen
Anglo-Saxons. The historian Bede tells us that all their
buildings were destroyed, the priests' blood was spilt
upon the altars, prelates and people were slain with the
sword, and all the cities and churches were burnt to the
ground. When all was lost and there was no longer a
church or home to defend, the Britons retired to the
country of their fellow-Christians, the secluded and
almost impenetrable hills and forests of the west. The
Anglo-Saxon love of gold was quickly recognised by the
people of West Wales who saved their property and bought
the right of worshipping after the manner of their fathers
by the payment of an annual tribute to their conquerors.</p>

<p>So ruthlessly indeed did the Anglo-Saxons rase to the
ground the early churches, that, until a few years ago, but
few traces of these early buildings were thought to exist.
<span class="sidenote">Church of<br />
S. Piran, Perranporth.</span>
An accidental discovery, however, in the year 1835,
brought to light an undoubted relic of an
early British church in the west, this being
the remains of a little church which had
been until the date above mentioned completely
buried in the sand on the sea coast
near Perranporth in Cornwall. They are thought by<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
ecclesiologists to be the remains of the original church
erected to the memory of S. Piran, a Cornish missionary
and a friend of S. Patrick, who was buried within its
walls before the year 500 A.D. On removing the sand,
the accumulated deposit of centuries, the church was
found to have consisted of a nave and chancel
containing a stone altar.<a name="img7" id="img7"></a></p>

<p>The building measured 29
feet in length, 16<sup>1</sup>&frasl;<sub>3</sub> feet in width and 19 feet from
the floor to the roof, and probably shares with S.
Mary's Church in Dover Castle, and S. Martin's, Canterbury,
the honour of being one of the earliest links
we possess with the ancient British Church. S. Mary's,
Dover, appears to have been built of Roman bricks and
cement, a combination which antiquaries consider is
found only in those buildings which were erected during
the Roman occupation.<span class="sidenote">S. Martin's, Canterbury.</span> S. Martin's Church, Canterbury
has many claims to be considered one of
our most interesting churches, no less on
account of its associations than for its
structural interest. The date of its building has been a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
source of endless controversy, as it contains many features
attributable to either Roman or Saxon architecture. It
is thought that it may possibly have been used for worship
by the Christian soldiers of the Roman army. Be this
as it may, it is established beyond doubt that it was the
oratory of Queen Bertha, the first English Christian queen,
who here worshipped, with her chaplain Liudhard, long
before the advent of S. Augustine, who himself in later
times preached here; and within the walls of this cradle
of English Christianity, Ethelbert, King of Kent, the
husband of Queen Bertha was baptized. The Venerable
Bede, writing within a hundred years of the death of S.
Augustine states that there was in 597 A.D. in Canterbury,
a church "dedicated to the honour of S. Martin and built
while the Romans still occupied Britain." On the departure
of the Romans it is probable that the church was
still used by a small band of Christian worshippers until
the heathen Jutes overran the Isle of Thanet in 449.</p>

<p>Little is known of the progress of Christianity on this
island from that date until the landing of S. Augustine in
597, and the first fruits of his mission, as we have seen,
was the conversion and baptism of King Ethelbert. As
one would naturally expect, the aspect of the structure
to-day, though suggestive of antiquity, is lacking in
uniformity of treatment. The brick courses in the nave
are at irregular intervals, varying from nine to twenty
inches apart, the spaces being filled with Kentish rag-stone
and occasional blocks of chalk. The chancel
extends eighteen or twenty feet east of the arch and is
composed of Roman bricks, evenly laid and averaging
four bricks to a foot. The chancel was lengthened at
the beginning of the thirteenth century and again at a
more recent date, so that its architecture to-day is of
three distinct periods. Outside may be seen five flat
pilaster buttresses and one semi-circular one, a square-headed
Roman doorway, a Saxon doorway and two Early
English porches; and there is also a nearly circular
panel on the south side of the nave, and a Norman
squint at the west end. There are many other features
of interest which bear evidences of a great antiquity, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
the only question which is seriously disputed is whether
the earliest portion of the present nave was built about
the end of the Roman occupation of Britain or during the
mission of S. Augustine.<a name="img8" id="img8"></a></p>

<p>The Rev. Charles F. Routledge,
M.A., F.S.A., Hon. Canon of Canterbury Cathedral,
writes: "Whatever may finally be determined to be the
date of the church's foundation, it can never lose its
unique association with S. Augustine, King Ethelbert and
Queen Bertha, nor its undisputed claim to be the oldest
existing church in England. From it flowed the tiny
spring of English Christianity, which has since widened
out into a mighty river, and penetrated the remotest parts
of the civilized and uncivilized world."</p>

<p class="noindent">Among other churches which show signs of having<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
been built during the Roman occupation are those of<span class="sidenote">Other Early Churches.</span>
Reculver, Richborough and Lyminge, while
the foundations of an undoubted early
church have been discovered in the old
Roman city of Silchester, in Hampshire.
<i>See <a href="#frontis">frontispiece.</a></i> The old church at Reculver
stood originally within the Roman castrum, the fortress
which guarded the northern mouth of the Wantsume, now
a small stream, but once an arm of the sea dividing the
Isle of Thanet from the mainland. The greater part of
this church was pulled down in 1809, but the western
towers, known as "the sisters" were repaired by Trinity
House, as they constitute a useful landmark for
mariners, being visible at a great distance.</p>

<p>Reculver church was built about A.D. 670, and from
the existing walls and foundations it is clear that its plan
was basilican. The church is now a ruin, but some stone
pillars which supported the arches are preserved in the
Cathedral Close at Canterbury.</p>

<p>As Reculver guarded the northern mouth of the watercourse,
so Richborough protected the south, and here
traces of a chapel in the form of a cross are plainly discernible
amongst ruins known to be of Roman workmanship.
The old church at Lyminge in the same county is
thus described by Canon Jenkyns, in his "<i>History of
Lyminge</i>":&mdash;"The Roman foundations discoverable at the
south-east angle of the chancel, together with the remarkable
half-arch that intervenes, marked the site of
the <i>aquilonalis porticus</i>&mdash;the title of basilica already
given to it in the seventh century establishes its claim to
great antiquity."</p>

<p>We thus see that although remains of the actual
buildings in which the British Christians worshipped
are few in number, yet enough are left us to prove
conclusively that there was a very active and zealous
Christian community established in these islands during
at least the period immediately preceding that in
which Rome withdrew her legions from Britain in order
to defend Italy against the Goths, and abandoned our
island to the mercy of her foes.</p>

<h3>EARLY CHURCH ARCHITECTURE.</h3>

<p>In the early years of the Christian Church, when its
members became sufficiently free from persecution
to erect buildings for the purpose of worship, they
were naturally anxious to avoid any of the forms peculiar
to either heathen or Jewish temples. Some model, however,
was necessary, and their choice being limited, they
appear to have adopted the simple style of the Roman
basilica, or court of justice. There was an adaptability
about the general plan of such a building which rendered
its selection natural and not inappropriate, while the
dignified simplicity of its construction and the object for
which it was primarily founded&mdash;the dispensation of
justice&mdash;commended it no doubt in the first instance as
a model for the primitive Christian church. These
basilic&aelig; were usually enclosures surrounded by a colonnade,
sometimes roofed, but more often open to the air,
and designedly built for the purpose of being accessible
to all members of the community at all times of the day.
They appear occasionally to have been used for the transaction
of ordinary business in which they would closely
resemble our exchanges. Be this as it may, this form of
architecture has left its impress on many Christian buildings,
and the name of basilica, for a church, is still used
in many parts of Italy.</p>

<p>The Roman basilica was usually in the form of a
parallelogram, with a seat for the judges at one end, and
in their adaptation of this form of building, the early
Christians devoted this place to the purposes of an altar.
This, by an easy and natural transition, is thought to
have given rise to the formation of the semi-circular
recess at one end of the building, known as the apse (from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
the Latin <i>apsis</i>, a bow or arch), which is still to be found in
some of our older churches.</p>

<p>Being thus Roman in the nature of their ground plan,
it is not surprising to find that other portions of the early
Christian buildings show decided characteristics of a
Roman style. On the destruction of the Pagan temples
by order of the Emperor Constantine about the year 330,
much of their material was built into the earliest Christian
churches, and the Roman character of their design being
prevalent, they formed a style of architecture which has
been designated Romanesque, of which the later styles,
known here as Saxon and Norman were largely modifications.
There is no reason to doubt that the earliest
Christian churches were very unpretentious in form and
that some time elapsed before there was anything which
could be called a definite church architecture, beyond that
to which we have alluded. Nevertheless, as the Church
strengthened her position and grew in security, more
attention was devoted to the subject of its edifices, and the
departure in time from the original ground plan furnished
an opportunity for the introduction of a more symbolical
and appropriate design. The plan of the old basilica was
abandoned for one in the form of the cross, the accepted
symbol of the Christian religion, which departure, however,
did not involve any very great alteration from the
old ground plan.</p>

<p>We come then to the time when one or other of the
forms known as the Latin or the Greek cross&mdash;whichever
was most convenient&mdash;was usually employed in a building
designed for Christian worship, and these forms are
universally found in the most elaborate structures of
which the Christian Church can boast.</p>

<p>As time passed, these cruciform churches were surmounted
with a dome, steeple, or tower at the point
where the members of the cross intersected each other.
At first the most prominent of these external adornments
was the dome; a characteristic of the architecture of
Eastern Europe, which acquired the name Byzantine,
from its having been carried to great perfection in Byzantium
(Constantinople), the capital of the Eastern Empire.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>The church of S. Sophia, which was built, much as it
now exists, early in the sixth century, and was afterwards
converted into a mosque, is an almost perfect example
of the Byzantine style. In this building we find the
Roman arch used in a variety of ways, while the dome
itself is formed entirely of this arch used as the crowning
work of the edifice. Eastern churches in this style
usually took the form of the Greek cross, this form being
better calculated to support the weight of the cupola. In
Western Europe, however, where the flat squat tower
afterwards developed into the steeple, as we shall see in
a later chapter, the Latin cross was mostly used, and this,
with a few notable exceptions, is the plan of most western
churches.</p>

<p>With writers of about fifty years ago, it was a favourite
theory that the Christians converted the old basilic&aelig; into
churches, and that the "Halls of Justice" erected by
the Romans in this country were also converted into
Christian churches, and some authorities point to the walls
and arches of Brixworth church in confirmation of this
theory. The late Mr. J. W. Brewer, however, stated that
unfortunately for this theory, no single example of a
basilica being converted into a church has been found
in this country and he himself held the theory that the
word basilica was used by the Romans to describe any
building which was supported by internal columns, and
in that way the name came to be applied to Christian
churches.</p>

<p>As we have seen, the early Christians, after a short
time, became dissatisfied with these buildings adapted
from Pagan types, and the Byzantine form of church
arose, the first people who practised this style of building
being the Greeks. The style spread with rapidity all
over the East, the great church of S. Sophia being its
largest example and the smaller, but more perfect, church
of S. Mark at Venice giving us the best idea of this form
of church architecture. Largely modelled on this style,
also, are the circular baptisteries of Italy and the round
churches of England, France and Germany, the modern
Russian churches and all the Mohammedan mosques. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
Latin churches did not greatly favour this style and their
use of it was confined, with few exceptions, to baptisteries,
monumental chapels and the like, but for parochial,
cathedral and monastic churches, the oblong plan was
retained and ultimately developed into the Gothic church
with its nave, transepts and chancel.</p>

<p>The changes which the Christian basilica at first underwent
were simple, <i>viz.</i>, the use of the arch instead of the
straight lintel, or the placing of an entablature between
the columns; a little later, about the tenth century, the
old wooden roof of the basilica gave place to the arched
roof or vaulting, so called from its being composed of a series
of vaults. The styles called Romanesque and Lombardic
are but geographical varieties of the same architecture
and from these the Saxon and Norman styles were soon
to be developed. The vaulted basilica church soon became
common over the north of Europe, the two most
important and practically unaltered examples being the
cathedrals of Speyer and Worms, in Germany, although
our Anglo-Saxon cathedrals of Peterborough, Ely and
Norwich may, so far as regards their naves, be justly
regarded as the offspring of the vaulted basilica style of
building.</p>

<p>When the old basilica style of church with its heavy
beam roof and its innumerable columns had ceased to
satisfy the lofty aspirations of Latin Christianity, and
when the Greeks had inaugurated a new style of church
architecture, only two courses were left to the Latins,
either to adopt the Greek style in its entirety, or to improve
upon the basilica type. Fortunately, although
after considerable hesitation, they chose the latter alternative,
the result being the genesis of our glorious
cathedrals with their long naves and aisles, deep transepts
and beautiful variety of form and outline.<a name="img9" id="img9"></a></p>

<h3>THE SAXON AND NORMAN STYLES.</h3>

<p>As we have seen in the previous chapter, the whole
subject of pre-Saxon church building is still very
obscure, and for some considerable time after the
Anglo-Saxon invasion little is known concerning church
architecture, nor has it yet been fully ascertained whether
any buildings of this period exist. By the year 588 the
Saxons were in complete possession of the land. Christianity
was to all appearance wiped out and the Church,
to the superficial observer was dead. In his "<i>History of
English Church Architecture</i>," Scott expresses the opinion
that the oldest English churches may be divided into
three groups. First, those which preceded the Danish
invasion; secondly, those from the above epoch to the
invasion of Sweyn; and thirdly, those onward to the
Norman Conquest.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Saxon<br />
Archi&shy;tecture.</div>
<p class="noindent">What exactly constituted Saxon architecture
has long been a controversial point
and one which will probably never be
definitely settled. Parker, in his "<i>Glossary
of Architecture</i>," says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><small>"For a considerable time, after they (the Anglo-Saxons) had
established themselves in this country, their buildings were of
wood, and this appears to have been the prevailing material
employed at the time of the Conquest, although stone had been
occasionally used several centuries earlier&#8230;. No timber-work
of Saxon date can be in existence at the present time, but
it is contended by some antiquaries that several of our churches
exhibit specimens of Saxon masonry; the truth of this theory,
however, is not fully established, nor has the subject of Saxon
architecture been yet sufficiently investigated to clear away the
obscurity in which it is involved."</small>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Probably few of our so-called Saxon churches were
built earlier than thirty or forty years before the Norman
Conquest, and it seems certain that for some years after
they had settled in England, the Normans employed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Saxon masons to build in the Saxon manner, as is seen
by the tower of S. Michael's Church, Oxford, which,
although showing all the characteristics of reputed Saxon
masonry was built many years after the Battle of Hastings.
Certain it is that these pre-Norman buildings in England
were singularly rude and rough and show how much our
Saxon ancestors were, at that period, behind the Italians,
French and Germans in architectural skill.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Saxon
Churches.</div>
<p class="noindent">Our best examples containing Saxon work are possibly
the churches at Sompting and Bishopstone, Sussex;
Bradford-on-Avon; Wootton Wawen (sub-structure
of tower); Wing; Brixworth, and
Barnack, Northants; Greenstead in Essex;
and S. Martin's at Wareham, Dorset.
Of towers of this date the best are possibly those of
S. Mary's and S. Peter's, Lincoln and S. Benet's,
Cambridge. Of crypts, the finest examples are at Ripon
Cathedral, York Minster (part) and S. Mary's Church,
York. In addition to these, many other churches
have chancel arches, doorways or some other less
important features which are considered to be of
Saxon origin.</p>

<p>These early buildings generally show the semi-circular
arch on the doorways, but the windows usually have a
triangular head; at Sompting church, however, the
windows have the semi-circular arch. It is necessary to
say a few words in detail about the more important
churches of this era.</p>

<div class="sidenote">S. Lawrence,
Bradford-on-Avon.</div>
<p class="noindent">The church of S. Lawrence at Bradford-on-Avon
is one of the oldest unaltered churches in England, and
it seems to be beyond question that it is
the actual church built by Ealdhelm at the
beginning of the eighth century and dedicated
by him to S. Lawrence. It consists
of a chancel, nave and north porch, and
among its remarkable features is its great height and the
extreme narrowness of the round-headed arch between
the nave and the chancel, a feature it has in common
with the Saxon church of S. Martin at Wareham; the
ground-plan measurements of both these churches are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
identical. At S. Lawrence's church, an incised arcade
is seen outside the walls, and on either side of the west
aspect of the chancel arch are two sculptured figures of
angels, which are thought to represent the earliest extant
fragments of church carving in England.<a name="img10" id="img10"></a></p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 250px;">

<span class="caption"><b>Tower of Earls' Barton Church</b><br />
Generally considered to have characteristics<br />
of Saxon masonry.</span></div>
<div class="sidenote">Brixworth,
Earls' Barton
and Barnack.</div>

<p class="noindent">Brixworth church is possibly older than S. Lawrence's
and it is said to have been in continuous use for Divine
Service ever since it was erected. The
tower appears to be of rather later date
than the nave and rests upon the walls of a
"narthex" or portico, which may have
extended along the
whole breadth of the
front, as is still to be
seen in churches at
Rome and Ravenna.
The curious pile of
masonry built up
against the tower may
have been added for
defence, as it could
hardly have formed
part of the original
design.</p>

<p>Earls' Barton and
Barnack churches both
have towers so covered
with narrow projecting
strips of stonework
that the surface of the
walls appears divided
into rudely formed
panels. The west doorways
of both show
primitive imitations of
Roman mouldings in
the imposts and architraves.
The tower of
Earls' Barton consists
of four stages, each of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
which is slightly smaller than the one below. In that of
Barnack church, the upper stages of the tower represent
the period of transition from Norman to Early English.</p>

<div class="sidenote">S. Michael's
Church, Oxford.</div>
<p class="noindent">S. Michael's, Oxford, has a massive tower of solid
masonry, unpierced in its lowest stage by either door or
window, the second stage shows but one
window and the highest is pierced by
several windows of more elaborate construction. Although generally consisting
of rubble and stone, Saxon churches were
sometimes built of wood as we see from the existing nave
of the parish church of Greenstead, Essex.<span class="sidenote">Greenstead
Church, Essex.</span> A brick chancel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
has been added at the east and a timber belfry at the west
end, but the old Saxon portion is composed
of large chestnut trees split asunder and set
upright close to each other with the round
side outwards. The ends are roughly hewn
so as to fit into a sill at the bottom, and
into a plate at the top, where they are fastened with
wooden pins. There are 16 logs on the south side where
are two doorposts, and on the north side twenty-one logs
and two spaces now filled with rubble. There is a
tradition that this church was erected to receive the body
of S. Edmund, on its return from London to Bury, in 1013.<a name="img11" id="img11"></a></p>

<p>The semi-circular arch has long been considered to be
one of the most distinctive marks of Norman architecture,
but Mr. Rickman, who made an exhaustive study of the
early churches of France and England, says:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p><small>"In various churches it has happened that a very plain arch
between nave and chancel has been left as the only Norman
feature, while both nave and chancel have been rebuilt at
different times; but each leaving the chancel arch standing.
I am disposed to think that some of these plain chancel arches,
will, on minute examination, turn out to be of Saxon origin."</small>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It would be tedious to enter into any more minute
account of the Anglo-Saxon ecclesiastical remains, and
the reader whose enquiries conduct him to the more
elaborate works on the subject will be startled by the
contrary opinions that he will surely encounter.</p>

<p>In concluding these brief remarks on early buildings,
we must again quote from Parker's work to which
reference has already been made:&mdash;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
<small>"The class of buildings referred to as being considered to
belong to this style contain some rather unusual features, and
they require to be particularly described, both because they are
in themselves remarkable, and because there is a probability
that some of them may be Saxon."</small>
</p>
</blockquote>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">Norman<br />
Archi&shy;tecture.</span>The Norman style of church architecture with its
varied forms of columns, moulded and recessed arches
and vaulting, may be roughly stated to
have been introduced into England at the
time of the Conquest. The Saxon masons
do not appear to have understood vaulting
sufficiently well to have roofed over any large space with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
stone, and for this reason alone the Saxon form of building
was bound to give way before the Norman, which of
all the earlier styles was the most advanced in this
respect.<a name="img12" id="img12"></a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>Generally speaking, Norman arches were semi-circular,
but they were by no means universally so, for a
form frequently found is one in which the spring of the
arch does not take place from the abacus, or upper
member of the capital, but at some distance above it and
when it assumes this form it is called a "stilted" arch,
suggested by some authorities to have been unintentional
and the result of imperfect construction
or planning. <i>See page <a href="#Page_10">10</a>.</i><a name="img13" id="img13"></a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Ornament.</div>
<p class="noindent">The main features in the ornamentation of this period
are the sculptured bands worked round the arches, which,
although generally called "mouldings,"
are more in the nature of decoration, and
in some instances they appear to be additions
carved on the originally unadorned surface of the
masonry. The earliest and most general ornament
is the chevron or zig-zag, which is frequently found
doubled, trebled and quadrupled. The next most common
form is the beak-head, consisting of a hollow and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
large round.<a name="img14" id="img14"></a></p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>In the hollow are placed heads of beasts
or birds whose tongues or beaks encircle the round. On
the west doorway of Iffley church, Oxford, are many
of these beak-heads extending the whole length of the
jamb down to the base moulding. They also figure
prominently among the ornamentations of the hospital
church of S. Cross, near Winchester. The zig-zag
moulding is very common on Norman churches and is
so easily recognised that no further description is needed
here. The less prominent decorations of Norman mouldings
include the alternate billet, the double cone, and the
lozenge, together with an immense number of others
less commonly found.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Windows.</div>

<p class="noindent">The Early Norman window was little better than a
narrow slit finished with a plain semi-circular head, and
was generally only a few inches wide.
They were, it is believed, filled with oiled
linen and the sides of the aperture were
splayed towards the interior. Later in the period, the
windows were enriched by the zig-zag and other mouldings
and at a still later period an improvement was made
by inserting nook-shafts in the jambs similar to those
in doorways.</p>

<p>The towers of Norman churches often show windows
of two lights separated by a central shaft, all enclosed
under a large semi-circular arch, the spandrel of which
is rarely pierced. Plain circular windows of small
dimensions are sometimes found in other positions and in
churches of later date, and occasionally in gable walls.
Larger windows of the same form, with small shafts
radiating from the centre and connected at the circumference
by semi-circular or trefoiled arches, are also
found as at Barfreston church, Kent, where there is a
fine example.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Doorways.</div>

<p class="noindent">Norman doorways are found in great numbers and
variety, even in churches which present no other features
in this style. The most usual form consists
of a semi-circular-headed aperture with a
hood-mould springing from plain square-edged
jambs. Frequently, however, the doorways are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
recessed, having a nook-shaft in the angle formed by
a recession from the capital, in which case it presents
two soffits and two faces, besides the hood-moulds. The
depth of these doorways is largely due to the great
thickness of the walls usual in buildings of this
period, but in many cases that portion of the wall
in which the entrance is inserted is made to project
forward beyond the general face, which projection is
finished either with plain horizontal capping, or a high-pitched
gable.<a name="img15" id="img15"></a></p>

<p>Norman porches thus have generally but
little projection, and are frequently so flat as to be little
more than outer mouldings to the inner door. They are,
however, often richly ornamented and have rooms above,
which rooms are wrongly called "parvises." The
shallow aperture often follows the form of the arch, but
is frequently square-headed, having a semi-circular
tympanum of masonry filling the space between the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>lintel of the door and the intrados of the arch. These
tympana are usually sculptured in low relief with a
representation of some scriptural or traditional event,
while the assertion of the Apostle that "we must, through
much tribulation, enter into the kingdom of God," may
account for the fondness of the Norman sculptors in
representing different stages of martyrdom on the tympana
of their doors. A very singular tympanum is that
on the door of the church of Fordington S. George, at
Dorchester, whereon is represented some incident in the
life of S. George.<a name="img16" id="img16"></a></p>

<p>The principal figure is on horseback
with a discus round his head. The other figures are in
hauberks and chausses, and generally bear, in point of
costume, much resemblance to the figures on the famous
Bayeux tapestry. Barfreston church, Kent, has an
interesting tympanum, as also has Patrixbourne church
in the same county, where the sculpture shows the
Saviour with dragons and at his feet a dog. At Alveston
church, Warwickshire, the sculpture shows two quadrupeds
with enormous tails, fighting, with between them
a small bird, possibly intended for a dove. Our best
example of a Norman doorway and tympanum is generally<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
considered to be the west doorway of Rochester Cathedral,
where the sculpture is of a very advanced character for
its date, which is probably about 1130-40.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Piers.</div>

<p class="noindent">A distinctive feature of the Norman style are the
massive pillars, usually circular, and with capitals either
of the same form, or square; occasionally
in plain buildings the pillars themselves
are square with very little or no ornamentation.
Towards the end of the period, an octagonal
pillar was often used, having a much lighter appearance
than the earlier forms. Besides these plain styles, compound
or clustered piers are very numerous, differing
considerably in plan; the simplest consists of a square
having one or more rectangular recesses at each corner,
but one more frequently met with has a small circular
shaft in each of the recesses and a larger semi-circular
one on each side of the square.<a name="img17" id="img17"></a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Capitals.</div>
<p class="noindent">Norman capitals are
very varied, having many different forms of
ornamentation; the commonest is one
which resembles a bowl with the sides
truncated, reducing the upper part to a square; sometimes
the lower part is cut into round mouldings and
ornamented, but it is frequently left plain.</p>

<p>The Norman
capital in its earliest style was of short proportions, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
afterwards it became longer, with lighter ornamentation,
gradually merging into the Early English. The bishops
and abbots of this period appear to have possessed
considerable skill in architecture, for no fewer than
fifteen of our English cathedrals contain some important
Norman work, as the older portions of the cathedrals of
Canterbury, Durham, Winchester, Gloucester, Peterborough,
Ely, Norwich, Lincoln and Oxford.<a name="img18" id="img18"></a></p>

<p class="noindent">The Norman buttress, better described by Mr. Sharpe
as a pilaster strip, unlike those of the later period,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
projects but very little from the wall, and this is
especially so in buildings of the earlier
part of the period. They are usually
quite plain and are more used for
finish than actual support; the Norman
builder relying principally upon the thickness and
weight of his walls to sustain any roof thrust (<i>see page <a href="#Page_17">17</a></i>).</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Round
Churches.</div>

<p class="noindent">There are in England a few round churches which are
thought to have been built by the Knights Templars, a
religious community banded together for the purpose
of wresting the Holy Sepulchre at Jerusalem
from the Saracens. Their object
was to defend the Saviour's tomb and to
guard Palestine, for which purpose they
built numerous monasteries throughout the Holy Land
and fortified them like castles.</p>

<p>Another famous order which combined the religious
instincts of the cloister with the military ardour of the
warrior was that of the Knights of S. John Baptist
or Knights Hospitallers, who, besides fighting, were
to tend the sick and provide for the welfare of
all Christian travellers. The churches belonging
to the Templars were usually built in circular form
in imitation of the church of the Holy Sepulchre
at Jerusalem. They were capped with vaulted concave
roofs said to be symbolical of the vast circuit
and concave of the heavens. Our best example is the
Temple Church, London, to which was added at a later
period, a beautiful Early English Gothic extension.
Other round churches are those of S. Sepulchre, Cambridge;
S. Sepulchre, Northampton; Temple Balsall,
Warwickshire, and of Little Maplestead, Essex,
which last, although the smallest, is by no means the
least interesting. It is attributed to the Hospitallers,
an order founded about the year 1092, and introduced
into England in the reign of Henry I. At
Clerkenwell may still be seen the ancient gateway leading
to their hospital.<a name="img19" id="img19"></a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span></p>

</div>

<p>The order was suppressed in 1545.
The church at Little Maplestead was built early in the
12th century, and in 1186 the adjoining manor was given
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>by
Juliana Doisnel to this order, which gift was confirmed
by King John and Henry III. This church is thought
to reproduce with more fidelity than the others the
original church of the Holy Sepulchre.</p>

<p>These famous Norman round-chancelled churches have
much in common with the old basilica form.</p>

<p>It must be pointed out that the arbitrary divisions into
which architecture has been divided&mdash;Norman, Gothic,
etc., are pure figures of the imagination, as by a series
of easy transitions, one style became gradually merged
into the next without any hard and fast
dividing lines whatever. The periods during
which one style became gradually blended
into another are called the periods of
transition.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The
Transition.</div>

<p class="noindent">Architecture being progressive, it was only by the
gradual development of one style from another that the
art was enabled to advance with social progress, the literature
and other arts of the country. The transition from the
Norman to the Early English style may be ascribed to a
period somewhat earlier than the 12th century, when a
great change in the construction of the arch began to
manifest itself. Alone, however, the form of the arch is no
real test, for many pure Norman works have pointed arches.
The square abacus may be taken as the best test. In its
incipient state the pointed arch exhibited a change of
form only, whilst the accessories and details remained
the same as before; and although this change gradually
led to the Early Pointed style in a pure state, with mouldings
and features altogether distinct from those of the
Norman, and to the general disuse, in the 13th century,
of the semi-circular arch, it was for a while so intermixed
as, from its first appearance to the close of the 12th
century, to constitute that state of transition called the
semi-Norman.<a name="img20" id="img20"></a></p>

<h3>THE EARLY ENGLISH STYLE.</h3>

<p>The origin of what is loosely called Gothic
architecture&mdash;which is generally considered to
include the styles, with their transitions, from
Early English to late Perpendicular, or Tudor-Gothic&mdash;is
not free from obscurity, but it is certain that it
began to be employed in ecclesiastical edifices about
the time that the Goths settled in Italy, although
all the available evidence goes to prove that the style
originated and underwent its earliest developments in
the north-west of Europe, and penetrated by slow
degrees to the south and east.</p>

<p>England was somewhat later than France in introducing
this style of architecture, our earliest purely
Gothic building being Salisbury Cathedral, begun in 1220,
although the choirs of Rievaulx and Fountains Abbey
were commenced a few years earlier. The Early English
style in its earliest developments is nowhere seen to
better advantage than in Salisbury Cathedral, and in its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
very latest forms
at Westminster
Abbey, the period
of time being
chronologically
measured by the
reigns of Richard
I., John and
Henry III.<a name="img21" id="img21"></a></p>

<p>Most of our
Gothic buildings
were carried out
under the supervision
of a master-mason,
but the
most subordinate
workman was left
plenty of scope
within reasonable
limits for whatever
artistic individuality
he possessed,
and the
enrichments and
ornaments of the
Gothic era point
out the noble aim,
the delicate and
graceful thought,
the refined and
exquisite taste
expended upon
every portion of
their buildings
by these Gothic
masons.</p>

<p>One of the
chief differences
between pure
Gothic and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
Norman architecture is in the use of the pointed form
of arch, yet in the study of the early buildings
of this date it is curious to notice how evenly the
balance is held between the pointed
and the round arch, and how at one time it
was quite an open question whether the
Gothic style would be distinguished by
a round or a pointed arch. <span class="sidenote">The Pointed
Arch.</span>In Germany and Italy
the round arch held its own and continued to be
used right through the Middle Ages. In England,
however, the pointed arch soon gained a decided victory
over its rival. Many theories have been put forward
concerning the introduction of the pointed arch, one
amongst them being that it was the result of the intersection
of two circular arches such as is very commonly
found in late Norman work; another theory is the
poetical idea that it was copied from an avenue of trees.
Whether or not either of these theories holds good,
it is quite certain that this form of arch was known
in the East for centuries before it reached Europe,
being found in cisterns and tombs in Egypt and Arabia
dating from long before the Christian era.</p>

<p>It has also been suggested that it was introduced
from the East by the Crusaders, in which case we should
have found it making its first appearance in Hungary,
Poland, Bohemia and Russia, but it so happens that
these were the very last countries in Europe to adopt
the pointed arch.</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="sidenote">The
Transitional
Period.</span>The first form of the pointed arch, known as the
Early English, was used from about 1180 to 1300,
including part of the reigns of Henry II., Richard I.,
John, Henry III. and Edward I. "Nothing," says
the Rev. J. M. Hutchinson, "could be more striking
than the change from Norman to Early
English. The two styles were the complete
opposites of each other; the round
arch was replaced by the pointed, often
by the acute, lancet; the massive piers
by graceful clustered shafts; the grotesque and rudely-sculptured
capitals by foliage of the most exquisite<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
character; and the heavy cylindrical mouldings by bands
of deeply undercut members."<a name="img22" id="img22"></a></p>

</div>

<p>Gothic architecture differs from all previous forms
in the economical use of material, and the small size of
the stones
used. Whereas
in both Roman
and Norman
buildings the
arrangement
of the materials
depended
upon their
strength in
masses, the
Gothic masons
employed
stones of small
size in the construction
of
edifices of
equal strength
and of far
greater magnificence;
while
in constructive
properties the
Gothic style
was a great
advance on
anything that
had gone before,
as the
buildings in
this style did
not depend for their stability on the vertical pressure
of columns, but on the correct adjustment of the
bearings and thrusts of different arches operating in
various directions. Owing to the fact, then, that each
portion of a Gothic Church helps to support something<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
besides itself, it is obvious that such buildings could
be erected with a far smaller quantity of material than
was previously necessary.</p>

<p>The various little shafts or
columns are so disposed as to distribute the weight
of the superstructure and thus relieve the greater
columns or
piers of
some portion
of the
superincumbent
weight; the
aisles help
to support
the nave;
the walls of the
side
chapels act
as abutments

the towers
are generally
placed
so as to resist

the arches

<p>The enrichments
and little
ornaments attached to mouldings, and particularly those
placed in the hollows, are most characteristic of the
various styles of Gothic architecture. The zig-zag is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
peculiar to the Norman, the nail head to the Transitional
or semi-Norman, and the dog tooth to
the Early English.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Early English Ornament.</div>

<p class="noindent">This last ornament
represents a flower, looking like four
sweet almonds arranged pyramidically,
and there is no other ornament so
distinctive of this period. Early English foliage is
known by reason of the stalks always being shown as
growing upwards from the lower ring of the capital,
called the astrigal. These stalks are generally grouped
together and curve forward in a very graceful manner.
The plants mostly represented are the wild parsley, seakale
and celery, and this foliage, called stiff-leaved foliage,
is found at no other period than the end of the 12th
century.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Early English
Mouldings.</div>

<p class="noindent">Early English mouldings are very complicated and
yet very beautiful, and consist of beads, keel and scroll
patterns, separated by deep hollows giving
a rich effect of light and shade round the
arch. These deeply-cut hollows are also
a distinctive mark of the style.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Early English
Windows.</div>

<p>The earliest windows of this period are long and
narrow, with acutely pointed heads, the exterior angle
being merely chamfered and the interior
widely splayed. Somewhat later the introduction
of tracery gave a highly beautiful
appearance to the windows and from the
character of this feature the date of the window can be
fairly accurately determined. Where the tracery is
formed by ornamental apertures pierced through a plate
of stone, it is called plate tracery, and is certain to be
of not later date than the earlier part of the 13th
century. If it is bar tracery, with the bars forming
plain circles, the work is also Early English, but if, on
the other hand, the bars form other shapes filled in
with patterns, or consisting of a single trefoil or quatrefoil,
they are of later date.<a name="Plate_2" id="Plate_2"></a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Early English
Porches.</div>

<p class="noindent">Early English porches project much further from
the main walls than do the Norman
doorways, and in large and important
buildings they frequently have a room
above. The gables are usually bold and
high pitched, and the interiors quite as rich in design<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
as are the exteriors.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Early English
Doorways.</div>

<p class="noindent">The doorways of this period are usually pointed,
though occasionally they have a semi-circular
head. The mouldings are boldly
cut and often enriched with dog tooth
ornament. The jambs frequently contain a shaft or
shafts with plain or foliated capitals (<i>see page <a href="#Page_51">51</a></i>).</p>

<div class="sidenote">Early English
Capitals and
Piers.</div>

<p class="noindent">Early English capitals are usually bell-shaped, and
are, in the smaller examples, quite devoid of ornament,
with the exception of a necking and
one or two mouldings round the abacus.
The bell is generally deeply undercut,
which, as in the mouldings, is a strong
characteristic of the style. The nail head
and dog tooth ornaments sometimes appear in the
hollows between the mouldings. In the large examples
the bell is covered with foliage, which, springing direct
from the necking, curls over most gracefully beneath
the abacus. In clustered piers the capitals follow the
form of the pier, and they also adopt the same form in
the single shaft, with the exception that multiangular
shafts have often circular capitals. The base consists
of a series of mouldings and frequently stands upon a
double or single plinth, which in the earlier examples
is square, but in later examples assumes the form of
the base, and is either circular or polygonal. At Stone
church, Kent, is a good example of an Early English
capital, decorated with stiff-leaved foliage, and the
dog tooth ornament, which in this case is seen
between the mouldings of the arch, and is of a
perforated character.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Early
English
Buttresses.</div>

<p class="noindent">The buttresses (<i>see page <a href="#Page_17">17</a></i>) of this period are, as a rule,
simple in form, and in small churches consist of two or
more stages, each set-off or division being
sloped at the top to carry off the rain.
In larger buildings the buttress generally
finishes with a triangular head or gable,
and is frequently carried above the parapet,
except where stone vaulting is used, in which case it is
covered with a pinnacle either plain or ornamented.

<h3>THE DECORATED STYLE.</h3>

<p>The best examples of Gothic architecture may be
said to have been erected between the years 1180
and 1300, and from the latter year many writers
date the commencement of its decline. In England we
owe nearly the whole of such magnificent buildings as
the cathedrals of Lincoln, Salisbury, Worcester, and the
abbey of Westminster to the 13th century, and there is
scarcely a cathedral or abbey that does not owe some
beautiful portion of its structure to the builders of the
same period, the transepts and lady chapel of Hereford
Cathedral, the eastern transepts of Durham, the nave
and transepts of Wells, the transepts of York, the choir
presbytery, central and eastern transepts of Rochester,
the eastern portion of the choir of Ely, the west front of
Peterborough, the choir of Southwell, the nave and
transepts of Lichfield, and the choir of S. David's being a
few of our most characteristic examples of this period.
The style which followed the Early English is known
as the Geometric or Early Decorated style, and it embraces
roughly the end of the 13th century and the first
twenty or thirty years of the 14th century, and continued
in its later or Curvilinear form to near the end of
that century. Perhaps the most perfect example of the
Geometric style in the world is the cathedral church at
Amiens, which is usually called the <i>mother church</i> of
this style, and although she has many daughters, none of
them can be said to equal their parent in beauty.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></p>

<p>In England the most perfect examples are not to be
looked for in cathedrals and large churches, but in their
chapels, and the most superb specimen we possessed,
S. Stephen's Chapel, Westminster, has been destroyed
within comparatively recent years. Those left to us
include the chapel of the palace of the bishops of Ely,
in Ely Place, Holborn, now the Roman Catholic Church
of S. Etheldreda, a building almost identical in plan
with the vanished chapel of S. Stephen. Trinity Church,
Ely, once Our Lady's Chapel, and Prior Crawden's
Chapel, in the same city, are lovely examples of the
latest development of the Curvilinear style, while the
former is considered the most highly-wrought building
in England. Belonging to this period, also, is the
choir of Merton College Chapel, Oxford, and Luton
Church.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Decorated
Windows.</div>

<p class="noindent">The Decorated style may be divided as regards its
windows into two classes&mdash;Geometric and Curvilinear.
The first has tracery evolved entirely from
the circle. The Curvilinear style is distinguished
by traceries formed by curved
and flowing lines. <i>See pages <a href="#Page_15">15</a> and <a href="#Page_59">59</a>.</i></p>

<p>Decorated windows are usually large and contain
from two to seven lights, although one sometimes finds a
window with a single light, but of less elongated form
than those of the Early English period.</p>

<p>As we have seen in a previous chapter, tracery
originated from the necessity of piercing that portion
of the wall which was left vacant when two lights were
gathered under a single arched dripstone, and therefore
elementary tracery consisted merely of apertures in a
flat surface. As the possibilities of this ornamental
feature became better understood, the mullions were
recessed from the face of the wall and the fine effect
thus produced was, as the art progressed, much enhanced
by the introduction of various orders of mullions, and
by recessing certain portions of the tracery from the
face of the mullions and their corresponding bars. The
geometrical tracery, as we have seen, consists of various
combinations of the circle, as the trefoil, based on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
triangle, the quatrefoil on the square, the cinquefoil on
the pentagon, etc.<a name="img27" id="img27"></a></p>

</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>In Curvilinear windows the tracery, although based on
the same forms and figures, is yet so blended into an
intricate pattern that each figure does not stand out
with the same individuality as in the Geometric. Among
our most beautiful Geometric windows are those of the
Lady Chapel at Exeter, Ely Chapel, and Merton Chapel,
Oxford, and of the Curvilinear our best example is
probably the east window of Carlisle Cathedral.</p>

<p>It must be noted that beautiful as are Curvilinear
windows, yet they mark a certain decadence in Gothic
architecture, in that it is an irrational treatment of
stone, and conveys the idea that the material was
bent and not cut into the required shape, it being a
well-established canon in art that when strength is
sacrificed to mere elegance it marks a decline in that
art.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Decorated<br />
Capitals<br />
and Piers.</div>
<p class="noindent">Decorated capitals as a rule follow the contour of the
pier in clustered columns, and are either bell-shaped
or octagonal. They are frequently only
moulded, thus presenting rounds, ogees
and hollows, on which the prevailing
ornaments of the period, the ball and the
square flower, are set. The foliated sculpture
is most exquisite, and is gracefully wreathed around
the bell, instead of rising from the astrigal or upper
member of the capital, as in the earlier style. Almost
every variety of leaf and flower is represented, the oak,
the vine and the rose being perhaps the most common,
but the leaves of the maple, hazel, ivy and strawberry
are all so beautifully rendered as to evidence their having
been directly studied from nature. Plucked flowers
too, are not uncommon, and sometimes the little stalks
and foliage are accompanied by birds, lizards, squirrels
and other creatures. The columns of this period are
much more elaborate than those of the Early English style,
and in plan have curved profiles with moulded members
between the shafts. These mouldings are very varied,
but the hollows not being so deeply undercut, the general
effect is broader and less liney than in the Early English;
while the Decorated arches are less sharply pointed than in
the previous style.<a name="img28" id="img28"></a>

<div class="sidenote">Decorated
Doorways.</div>
<p class="noindent"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>The doorways of this style possess much the same
features as the last, but the mouldings, jamb shafts, etc.,
are more slender, and generally of finer
proportions, the hollows being often filled
with the ball flower and square flower
instead of the dog tooth. Sometimes the
doorways have no pillars, being entirely composed of
mouldings which are continuous with those in the architrave.
The large single doorways of this period are
nearly as large as the double ones of Early English date,
and on the sides small buttresses or niches are sometimes
placed, and often one finds a series of niches carried
up like a hollow moulding, and filled with figures. The
figures of this period are not so good as in the previous
style, the heads seem too large for the bodies, and in
the female figures the breasts are represented as quite flat.
Where there are no figures double foliated tracery is
often found hanging from one of the outer mouldings,
giving an effect of great richness.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Decorated<br />
Buttresses.</div>

<p class="noindent">The buttresses (<i>see page <a href="#Page_17">17</a></i>) in the Decorated style are
nearly always worked in stages, and a niche frequently
figures on the face of the buttress.
Crocketed canopies and other carved
decorations are common, and in large buildings
they usually terminate in pinnacles,
which are sometimes of open work.</p>

<p>A Gothic building attains its effect by the combination
of numerous parts, each possessing an individual
character of its own. In its loftiness, graceful outlines,
and rich effect of light and shade, it speaks of noble
aspirations, of freedom, of intellectual thought,
of talent and skill, all generously given for a high
purpose, the foundation of which was a strong
religious enthusiasm, combined with an intense love
of the work itself.</p>

its details are mostly geometrical in its
window traceries, clusters of shafts and
bases, but this geometric quality is only
one of construction and form and not of
its inner spirit and motive, for plants
copied directly from nature were used in beautiful
profusion.</p>

<p>If we compare a large Gothic church with a comparatively
small one, we shall find the columns, windows,
ornaments of the former are not so very much larger
than those of the latter, but that there are double or
three times the number of them. This is not the case in
a classical building, where each feature has to be enlarged
in proportion to the size of the building. It is the
constant sub-division of a Gothic Church which adds
so to its apparent size.</p>

<p>Ornamentally, the Gothic is the geometrical and
pointed elements repeated to their utmost and afterwards
combined with the elaboration of natural objects, plants,
flowers, etc., growing in the neighbourhood of the work.
This is a great feature, but the most striking point in
all good Gothic work is the wonderful elaboration of
geometric tracery, vesicas, trefoils, quatrefoils and
an immense variety of other ornament.</p>

<p>In regard to the sizes of our great churches it may
be of interest to note that our longest English cathedral
is Winchester. York and Lincoln, although not so
long as Winchester, are in superficial area very much
larger. The largest English church of a non-cathedral
rank is Westminster Abbey, which has, moreover, the
distinction of being the loftiest internally; the nave being
104 ft. in height. The largest parish church is that of
S. Nicholas, Great Yarmouth, which exceeds in superficial
area no fewer than eight of our cathedrals.

<h3>THE PERPENDICULAR STYLE.</h3>

<p>Towards the close of the XIVth century a great
change came over English Gothic architecture, a
change which was to a certain extent a return to
classical ideas. The curvilinear tracery gave place to
a rigid vertical and horizontal form, with the result that
windows and panels instead of being filled with curved
bars of stone, were sub-divided by straight perpendicular
bars and transoms or cross-bars.</p>

<p>This style of architecture is popularly known as
Perpendicular, but as the horizontal lines are quite as
distinct a feature as are the vertical, it would perhaps
be more correct to speak of it as Rectilinear. This
change in architectural form made its appearance towards
the close of the XIVth century, although it was by no
means generally introduced at that period, for the old
methods and styles were carried on side by side with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
new for many years.<a name="img30" id="img30"></a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>For example, the eastern end of
the choir of York Minster (1361-99) possesses a window
the traceries of which contain both curvilinear and
rectilinear lines, while Shottesbrook Church in Berkshire
(1387), and Wimmington Church, Bedfordshire
(1391) are examples of village churches neither of which
has any feature of the Perpendicular style.</p>

<p>In its earlier stages the Perpendicular style presented
an effect at once good and bold; the mouldings, though
not equal to the best of the Decorated style, were well
defined, the enrichments effective, and the details
delicate without extravagant minuteness. Subsequently
the style underwent a gradual debasement; the arches
became depressed; the mouldings impoverished, the
details crowded and coarsely executed, and the whole
style became wanting in the chaste and elegant effects
for which the Decorated stands unapproached and
unapproachable. The flowing contours and curved lines
of the previous style now gave place in the windows
to mullions running straight up from the bottom to the
top, and crossed by transoms. As the arch became
more and more depressed the mouldings became shallower
and less effective. In early buildings of this period the
drop arch is very prevalent, but as the period advanced
a form known as the Tudor arch began to be used. It
is an arch in which, as a rule, the centres of the upper
portion lie immediately below those of the lower, but
this is not always the case. Sometimes the whole of
the upper portion uniting the arcs of the ends is struck
from one centre, in which case the arch becomes a
three-centred one, being, in fact, half an ellipse.
Towards the close of the style the curvature of the
upper portion is so slight that it can hardly be distinguished
from a straight line, and as the debasement
progressed it became really straight. Ogee arches
are also found at this period, and foiled arches are very
frequent. When the Tudor arch was not used, we
generally find the low drop arch, these three last being
mostly used for small openings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>

Windows.</div>

<p class="noindent"><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>The
peculiar characteristics of the windows&mdash;the
perpendicular mullions and horizontal transoms&mdash;we have
already alluded to. The window heads,
instead of being filled with flowing tracery,
have slender mullions running from the
heads of the lights between each mullion,
and these again have smaller transoms, until the whole
surface of the window becomes divided into a series of
panels, the heads of which being arched, are trefoiled
or cinquefoiled. In the later windows the transoms at
the top are often furnished with a small ornamental
battlement, causing the mullions to present a concave
outline.<a name="img32" id="img32"></a></p>

</div>

<p>The plans of churches in this style differ from all
others in that they are more spacious, the columns more
slender and wider apart, the windows much larger, and
the walls loftier and thinner. Panelling is used most
abundantly on walls, both internally and externally, and
also on vaulting, while some buildings, as Henry the
Seventh's Chapel at Westminster, are almost entirely
covered with it. Fan tracery vaulting, a feature peculiar<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
to this style, is almost invariably covered with panelling.</p>

<p>The mouldings of this period are essentially different
from those which preceded them. As a general rule
they are cut on a slanting or chamfer plane, the groups
of mouldings being separated by a shallow oval-shaped
hollow, entirely different from those of the Decorated
period.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Perpen&shy;dicular
Doorways.</div>
<p class="noindent">The doorways of the early portion of this period had
two-centred arches, but the characteristic form is the
four-centred, enclosed in a square head,
formed by the outer mouldings with a
hood mould of the same shape, the spandrels
being filled with quatrefoils, roses,
shields, etc.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Perpen&shy;dicular
Capitals.</div>

<p class="noindent">Perpendicular capitals are either circular or octagonal,
but the necking is usually of the former shape, and the
upper members of the abacus of the latter
form. The bell portion is mostly plain,
but is often enriched with foliage of a
very conventional character, shallow and
formal, without either the freedom or the boldness
of the Early English, or the exquisite grace of the Decorated
periods. A distinguishing feature in the ornamentation
of this period is that called panel-tracery,
with which the walls and vaulted ceilings are covered.
<span class="sidenote">Fan
Vaulting.</span>The patterns are found in a variety of forms, as circles,
squares, quatrefoils, etc. The rich vaulting
called fan vaulting previously alluded
to, is composed of pendant curved semi-cones,
covered with foliated panel-work,
which bears some resemblance to a fan spread open.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Perpen&shy;dicular
Ornament.</div>

<p class="noindent">Another very characteristic ornament is the Tudor
flower. It is formed by a series of flat leaves placed
upright against the stalk. It was much
used in late buildings as a crest or ornamental
finishing to cornices, etc., to which
it gave an embattled appearance. Cornices
and brackets were frequently ornamented with busts of
winged angels called angel-brackets, and angel-corbels.
The portcullis and the Tudor rose&mdash;both badges of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
house of Tudor&mdash;also figure prominently among the
ornaments of the period. The crockets for the most
part partake of the squareness which pervades all the
foliage of this style. <i>See page <a href="#Page_64">64</a>.</i></p>

<div class="sidenote">Perpen&shy;dicular
Buttresses.</div>
<p class="noindent">The buttresses are very similar to those preceding
them in their plainer forms, but, in richer examples
the faces are covered with panel work
and are finished with square pinnacles
sometimes set diagonally and terminated
with a crocketed spire, or finished with an
animal or other ornament. Parapets with square battlements
are very common at this period, but they too are
frequently panelled or pierced with tracery, or with
trefoils or quatrefoils inserted in square, circular or
triangular compartments.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Perpen&shy;dicular
Roofs.</div>

<p class="noindent">The roofs of this period, both in ecclesiastical and
secular buildings, are very magnificent, and have the
whole of the framing exposed to view;
many of them are of high pitch, the
spaces between the timbers being filled
with tracery, and the beams arched,
moulded and ornamented in various ways; and frequently
pendants, figures of angels, and other carvings
are introduced. The flatter roofs are sometimes lined
with boards and divided into panels by ribs, or have
the timbers open, and all enriched with mouldings and
carvings, as at Cirencester church, Gloucestershire.</p>

<p>The gradual decline of the Gothic style is very evident
in late Perpendicular churches, especially in those
erected at the beginning of the XVIth century. The
elements of Gothic architecture became much degraded
and led to that mixture of features called the Debased
Gothic in which every real principle of art and of beauty
was lost.</p>

<p>The chief characteristics, then, of the Perpendicular
style are the vertical mullions, and the general flattening
of arches, mouldings and carvings. Should there be
no other guide, a Perpendicular church carries its style
and period stamped upon its carvings.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>

<p>The plants
represented are, almost without exception, the vine
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>with or without grapes, and the oak with or without
acorns. The leaves are generally full blown and crumpled.
The earliest building showing the Perpendicular style is
the beautiful little priory church of Edington, in Wilts,
erected by William Edington, Bishop of Winchester.
The same style, but more fully developed, is seen in
the nave of Winchester Cathedral, at New College,
Oxford, and at Winchester College.</p>

<p>It is generally admitted that the Perpendicular style
was, to a certain extent, a return to classical ideas, for
Gothic architecture in its aspiring grace and feeling for
motion was becoming a little unsteady in construction,
and although the movement was started by Bishop
Edington, it was left to William of Wykeham to save
our English Gothic architecture from developing into
the flamboyant<a href="#fn1" class="fnanchor"><small><sup>1</sup></small></a> style so characteristic of the late Gothic
buildings of France and Germany.</p>

<p>It is little less than astounding that William of Wykeham,
at once Prime Minister, diplomatist, scholar and
energetic churchman, should have found time to introduce
such far-reaching reforms into the art of building,
and whatever his fame may be in other directions he
will always be remembered by posterity as one of the
most remarkable geniuses of the Middle Ages, a man
of giant mind and immense physical energy, who carried
into all his work a large and dignified character,
stamping it with the unmistakable personality of a
master mind.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Perpen&shy;dicular Towers.</div>
<p class="noindent">As builders and designers of church towers the masons
of the Perpendicular era have never been approached,
and all our finest English towers are of
this style and period. Considerations of
space will only allow a few of these towers
to be mentioned, but among the finest
are those at Boston, Lincolnshire; Wrexham,
Denbighshire; Wymondham, Heigham and S.
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>Clement's in Norfolk; Southwold Church in Suffolk;

<p>Of Perpendicular date
and style, also, are the great lantern towers of Worcester,
Bristol, Gloucester, York and Durham Cathedrals, in
addition to the fine bell-tower of Evesham Abbey.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Perpen&shy;dicular Spires.</div>
<p class="noindent">The
spire, although less commonly used than
formerly, was by no means abandoned,
and beautiful examples of Perpendicular
spires are those at S. Michael's, Coventry,
and Rotherham Church, Yorkshire. Although nearly
all our cathedrals have some portion of their fabric in
the Perpendicular style, chantries, chapels, cloisters,
vaulting, screens, etc., it was in our parochial churches
that Perpendicular architecture reached its highest
and finest development. Just as the XIIIth century
was the great age for cathedral building, so the latter end
of the XIVth and earlier half of the XVth centuries was
the period to which we owe some of the most beautiful
of our parish churches, as S. Michael's, Coventry
(fin. 1395); S. Nicholas, Lynn (fin. 1400); Manchester
Cathedral (formerly a collegiate church), (1422); Fotheringay
Church, Northants (fin. 1435); Southwold Church,
Suffolk (1440), and S. Mary Redcliffe, Bristol (about
1442). A little later came, among others, Wakefield
Church, Yorkshire (1470), S. Stephen's, Bristol (1470),
S. Mary's, Oxford, and its namesake at Cambridge (both
in 1478) and Long Melford Church, Suffolk (1481).</p>

<p>Apart from the actual buildings the Perpendicular
architects, masons and sculptors have left us some
beautiful work in the form of timber roofs, screens,
stalls and seats. Among the more notable roofs of this
period are those at S. Peter's, S. Andrew's and S. Mary's,
Norwich, the one at Morton Church in Somerset, those
at Saffron Walden and Thaxted, Essex, and a particularly
fine one at S. David's Cathedral in Wales. Among the
remarkable domestic roofs in this style are those at
Westminster Hall and Eltham Palace.</p>

<h3>THE RENAISSANCE AND LATER.</h3>

<div class="sidenote">The Classic Revival.</div>
<p class="noindent">So far we have been considering Gothic churches,
but we now come to the time when, from a
variety of causes, the Italian architects, among
them Palladio and Vitruvius, began to revive classical
architecture, a movement which gradually
spread over other parts of Europe.
The various causes which led to this
apparently retrograde movement are still
involved in considerable obscurity. The
commercial prosperity of the age produced a class
who travelled abroad and cultivated the fine arts,
with the result that they desired to see erected in
England buildings such as they had seen in Rome,
Florence, Genoa and Padua. It is generally admitted
that the ramifications of Gothic architecture had
reached their utmost limit, and the style was getting
out of hand, as is seen by the flamboyant buildings on
the continent. The revival of classical literature in
western Europe gave an impetus to the movement
which was largely intended to enfold art within the
shelter of an enlightened taste, and protect it from the
licence of unordered enthusiasm. How far it succeeded
is not a question that can be discussed at length here,
but, however good their intentions may have been, the
architects used little discrimination in the selection of
buildings which were to serve as models for Christian
churches, and although subsequently considerable improvements
were made, yet, most of the defects in the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
pagan buildings of the ancients were retained in such as
were intended to be utilized for Christian worship, and even
considered purely as exercises in architecture it was not
until the more chaste remains of antiquity began to be
studied that the spirit and harmony of the good examples
were attained. A greater contrast than the methods
employed by the Gothic mason and the Renaissance
architect could not well be imagined. The former
shaped his material with his own hands; the foster
mother of his art was tradition and its cradle the craftsman's
bench; whereas the latter, with no builder's
training, worked out his flawless and precise plans in
the exotic atmosphere of the office and the study. The
practice of making working drawings for every detail
of the building was the cause of the decline of ornamental
sculpture, with the result that all life and growth in the
building ceased. Some authorities are very severe on
the Renaissance movement. Dr. Fergusson, in his
"<i>Modern Styles of Architecture</i>," says: "During the
Gothic era the art of building was evolved by the simple
exercise of man's reason, with the result that the work
of this period is the instinctive natural growth of man's
mind. The buildings, on the other hand, which were
designed in the imitative styles, and produced on a
totally different principle, present us with an entirely
different result, and one which frequently degrades
architecture from its high position of a quasi-natural
production to that of a mere imitative art."</p>

<div class="sidenote">Inigo Jones<br />
and Wren.</div>
<p class="noindent">Be this as it may, the severe classical style introduced
into England by Inigo Jones (who studied
in Italy under Palladio), and continued by
Sir Christopher Wren, soon swept everything
before it.</p>

<p>Our most remarkable church in this style is S.
Paul's Cathedral, which in style has two very adverse circumstances
to struggle against. In the first place, it
bears so great a similarity to the great church of S.
Peter, at Rome, that one cannot help comparing it with
that fine example, and secondly, it is the only English
cathedral which is not in the Gothic style. It must, of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
course, be acknowledged that S. Paul's falls far short
of S. Peter's, especially in its lighting, but it does not
deserve the condemnation of a great German critic, who
said, "It is a building marked neither by elegance of
form nor vigour of style." Although the interior of its
dome and clerestory of the nave and choir are extremely
gloomy when compared with those of S. Peter's, the
church is generally acknowledged to be far superior
to the latter in its architectural details, and few, if any,
Italian churches can be said to surpass it, either in
general composition or external effect, although it must
be admitted that everything having been sacrificed to
attain the latter quality, S. Paul's taken as a whole, is
neither worthy of its fine situation nor of its great architect.</p>

<p>Other churches which are excellent examples of this
style are S. Stephen's, Walbrook, and S. Mary Abchurch,
London. Both show remarkable skill. The former is
divided into a nave and four aisles, transepts, and a shallow
chancel, by four rows of Corinthian columns, with a
small dome over the intersection. The interior is very
beautiful, and this church is generally considered to be
Wren's masterpiece. S. Mary Abchurch, is nearly
square in plan, has no columns and is covered with a
domical ceiling, but so skilfully treated that the effect
is singularly pleasing.</p>
<div class="sidenote">Hawkes&shy;more.</div>
<p class="noindent">Of the Elizabethan and Jacobean buildings it is necessary
to say little, as at best they are but clumsy imitations
of the Flemish, French and Italian Renaissance, while
the style which we now call Queen Anne came in towards
the close of the XVIIth century, and belongs of right to the
reign of Charles II.</p>

<p>Hawkesmore, a pupil
and follower of Wren, was a strong architect
who has left us Christ Church, Spitalfields,
and S. Mary Woolnoth. He also designed the western
towers of Westminster Abbey, often wrongly ascribed
to Wren, and the second quadrangle of All Saints'
College, Oxford. This architect, like the majority of
his contemporaries, misunderstood and despised the
Gothic style, with which he had little real sympathy;
he drew out designs, which still exist, for converting<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
Westminster Abbey into an Italian church, just as Inigo
Jones had done with the exterior of the nave of old S.
Paul's, but we cannot be too thankful that this abominable
suggestion was never carried out.<a name="img34" id="img34"></a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>With King George III. on the throne our ancestors
contented themselves with dull, but substantial, buildings
of which some hard things have been written, but they
were at least respectable and free from sham, while
the churches, although not elegant, were well-built and
occasionally picturesque, as we see by the perfect little
building of this date at Billesley, Warwickshire.</p>

<p>The eighteenth century pseudo-classical abominations
and sham Gothic, so favoured by Horace Walpole and
his admirers, can be briefly dismissed. A more rampant
piece of absurdity than that of erecting imitations of
portions of Greek temples and adapting them for Christian
worship it is difficult to imagine, and in the Pavilion
at Brighton, Marylebone Church, and the "Extinguisher"
Church in Langham Place we even surpassed in bad
taste and vulgarity all the absurdities of the Continental
architecture produced by the French Revolution.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Barry and<br />
Pugin.</div>
<p class="noindent">Two men now came on the scene who, united, were
destined to bring some kind of order out of this chaos.
Barry and Pugin were both scholars and
architects, for while the former rather
favoured the classical style he thoroughly
understood the Gothic, while Pugin was
a thorough medi&aelig;valist, a true artist, and a bold exponent
in his "<i>Contrasts</i>" of a complete return to medi&aelig;val
architecture as the only possible cure for the evils which
had crept into the art of building.</p>

<p>Barry's idea, which was perhaps the more practical,
was to correct by careful study the errors into which the
later exponents of both Classic and Gothic architecture
had fallen, and endeavour by well thought out modifications
to evolve a style more suitable to modern requirements.
Pugin, however, would have none of the evil
thing, and although he supplied his friend with designs
for the details and woodwork of the Houses of Parliament
which Barry was rebuilding, they did not collaborate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
in any further way, and both died before the Houses
of Parliament were completed, in which, as a matter of
fact, Barry's designs were completely ignored. The
Reform Club is considered to be the best of Barry's
classical buildings.</p>

<p>Pugin's earlier works were mostly Roman Catholic
churches, and they are acknowledged to be an immense
advance on any Gothic work which had been seen for
centuries. In the Roman Catholic Cathedral of S. Chad,
at Birmingham, there is a dignity, loftiness and simplicity
surpassed by few Gothic buildings when that style was
at its zenith, and from the time Pugin designed this
building, architecture&mdash;notwithstanding our exhaustive
study of arch&aelig;ology, our immense resources of capital
and labour, our science and labour-saving appliances, and
the comparative accessibility of the finest materials&mdash;has
neither developed nor advanced. The most erudite
Gothic mason could have possessed but little art knowledge
as compared with the modern architect, and yet
with our learned societies, wonderful libraries, easily
obtained photographs and plans of the best buildings
in the world; with writers far superior in intellectual
acquirements to those of the Middle Ages, our vast
wealth, with our tools such as the medi&aelig;val craftsman
could never have dreamed of, and with the experience
of twenty centuries to guide us we have made no
advance during more than half a century. Our best
architects acknowledge that until we get a new method
of building, originality in architecture is an impossibility,
mainly because all the existing styles of architecture
have been worked out to their legitimate conclusion,
and have been perfected under circumstances and conditions
with which we have entirely broken; the originality
in detail which pervades and permeates our Gothic
buildings and gives them the greater part of their charm,
must, of necessity, be out of our reach until we blend
the spirit of what we are pleased to call our practical
age, with a certain amount of that spirit of poetry and
romance, religious fervour and devoutness, which
animated the builders and craftsmen of the past.<a name="img35" id="img35"></a>

<h3>CHURCH FURNITURE AND ORNAMENTS.</h3>

<p>The most important part of the internal furniture of
a church is the altar, a name derived from the
Latin <i>altare</i>, a high place. <span class="sidenote">The Altar.</span>The altar is a raised
structure on which propitiatory offerings are placed. In the
Christian church the altar is a table or slab on which the
instruments of the Eucharist are displayed. The early<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
Christian altars were portable structures of wood, and
the Church of Rome still allows the use
of an altar of this description, although a
consecrated stone, containing an authentic
relic and regarded as the true altar, must be placed
upon the wooden table. The slab forming the altar
was sometimes supported on pillars, but more frequently
on solid masonry, and previous to the Reformation it
was marked with five crosses cut into the top, in allusion
to the five wounds of Christ. From the period that
stone altars were introduced it was usual to enclose
within them the relics of saints, so that in some cases
they were the actual tombs of saints. In England the
altars were generally taken down about the year 1550,
set up again in the beginning of the reign of Queen
Mary, and again removed in the second year of Queen
Elizabeth. In the church of Porlock, Somerset, the
original high altar has been preserved, though not in
use, being placed against the north wall of the chancel.
In Dunster Church, in the same county, there is a solid
stone altar, said to have been the original high altar,
and in the ruined church of S. Mary Magdalene at Ripon,
the high altar has escaped destruction. Of chantry
altars we have several left, including those at Abbey
Dore, Herefordshire; Grosmont, Monmouthshire; Chipping
Norton, Oxon.; Warmington, Warwick; S. Giles's,
Oxford; Lincoln Cathedral, and many others; and it
is rare to find a Gothic church without some traces of
altars in their various chapels, oratories or chantries.</p>

<p>The altar is, of course, an adoption by the Christian
church of a pagan aid to worship, and at S. Mary's
church, Wareham, which is thought to stand on the
site of a Roman temple, are some pieces of stone considered
by antiquaries to be portions of a pagan altar,
on which burnt offerings were placed.</p>

<p>Above many Christian altars was placed a piece of
sculpture or a painting representing some religious
subject. These altar pieces sometimes consist of two
pictures, when they are called "diptyches," and sometimes
of three pictures, when they are called "triptyches,"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
and both forms usually fold up or are provided with
shutters. They are often rare examples of the Flemish
and other schools of painting, and of great value.</p>

<p>At the Reformation the stone altar was displaced by
the communion table, which at first occupied the position
vacated by the altar. This gave umbrage to the Puritan
mind, and the communion table was then usually placed
in the centre of the chancel, with seats all round for the
communicants; which arrangement is still in vogue
in some of our English churches and in Jersey, although
at the Restoration the communion
table was, as a
general rule, replaced at the
eastern wall of the Chancel.<a name="img36" id="img36"></a></p>

<img src="images/img088c.jpg" width="150" alt="Durham Sanctuary Knocker." title="" />
<span class="caption"><b>Durham Sanctuary Knocker</b></span></div>

<p>Long before the Christian
era the altar was regarded as
a place of refuge for those fleeing
from justice or oppression,
and this custom or privilege
of sanctuary was sanctioned
by the English bishops
and was retained for many
centuries by the Christian
Church. Many of our parish
churches claim to possess old
sanctuary rings or knockers,
but it is doubtful if any of these were ever used by fugitives,
for the reason that although in early days every parish
church had the right to grant sanctuary, few possessed
the means of feeding and housing a refugee, save in the
church itself, which was expressly forbidden. This is
why we find records of fugitives travelling many miles
at the risk of their lives and passing hundreds of parish
churches in their endeavour to reach Bury St. Edmunds,
Hexham, Durham or some other of the well-recognised
sanctuaries. The only sanctuary knocker remaining
to-day, which is above suspicion, is that at Durham
Cathedral. It is made of bronze and represents the
grotesque head of a dragon, the ring coming from the
mouth. Above the door is a small room in which<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
attendants watched by day and night, and when a fugitive
was admitted a bell was rung to announce that someone
had taken sanctuary.<a name="img37" id="img37"></a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>The font, as we have seen, was originally placed in
a separate building called the baptistery.<span class="sidenote">The Font.</span> The only
known example of anything of the kind
in England is that in S. Mary's Church,
Luton, fully described in The Homeland
Handbook, No. 47. It is in the Decorated style, dates
from the time of Edward III., and is said to have been
designed by William of Wykeham for Queen Philippa.
It is composed of white stone with open panels, pierced
by cinquefoils and quatrefoils, while the apex of each
panel terminates in a foliated finial. The font inside
is octagonal in form and of 13th century date, but it
has been somewhat restored. Ancient fonts were
always large enough to allow for total immersion, and
our present custom of baptism by affusion, or sprinkling,
is only permitted, not enjoined by the rubric. In early
days the sacrament of baptism was only administered
by the bishops at the great festivals of Pentecost and
Easter, for the reason that this afforded the greater
convenience for immediate confirmation, but with the
increase in the number of churches the rite was administered
by the priests in every village.</p>

<p>The font was
required by the canon to be of stone, but there are a
few Norman fonts made of lead, among them those at
S. Mary's Church, Wareham, Walton-on-the-Hill, Surrey,
and at Edburton, Parham, and Pyecombe, Sussex. A
remarkable font is that at Dolton Church, Devon, made
up of fragments of the churchyard cross, and there is
also a somewhat similar one at Melbury Bubb, Dorset.
By a constitution of Edmund, Archbishop of Canterbury
(1236), fonts were required to be covered and locked,
and at first these covers were little more than plain lids,
but they afterwards became highly ornamental and were
enriched with buttresses, pinnacles, crockets, etc. It is
doubtful if any fonts exist which can reasonably be supposed
to be Saxon, although a few, like that at Little Billing,
Northants, may possibly be of that era. Of Norman<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
fonts we have large numbers. They are sometimes
plain hollow cylinders; others are massive squares
with a large pillar in the centre, and small shafts at the
corners. These fonts are generally ornamented with
rudely executed carvings, consisting of foliage and
grotesque animals.<a name="img38" id="img38"></a></p>

<p>The one in Winchester Cathedral
is a good example, and there are three other very
similar ones in Hampshire. Early English fonts are
very often circular, and sometimes square, and they are
often supported in much the same way as the Norman
ones. In the Decorated and Perpendicular styles they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
are, with few exceptions, octagonal, and the details
generally partake of the character of those used in the
other architectural features of the period. There are
hexagonal fonts of Decorated date at Rolvenden, Kent,
and Heckington, Lincs. The font is usually placed close
to a pillar near the entrance, generally that nearest but
one to the tower in the south arcade, or, in larger buildings,
in the middle of the nave.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stoups.</div>

<p class="noindent">The holy-water stoups sometimes found in our old
churches are generally small niches with stone basins
formed in the wall either in or just outside
the porch, or within the church close to
the door, or in one of the pillars nearest
to the door. These niches resemble piscinas, except
that they differ in
situation, are smaller
and plainer, and rarely
have a drain. A good
example of an outside
stoup is that at Broadmayne,
Dorset, where
there is also one inside
the church. They are
rarely found unmutilated,
but there is one
in perfect condition in
the north porch of
Thornham Church,
Kent; and a rather
elaborate example at
Pylle Church, near
Glastonbury.<a name="img39" id="img39"></a></p>

<span class="caption"><b>A Reputed Saxon Font.</b><br />

</div>

<p>The piscina is a
water-drain formerly
placed near the altar
and consisting of a
shallow stone basin, or
sink, with a drain to
carry off whatever is
poured into it. It was used to receive the water in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
which the priest washed his hands, as well as for that
with which the chalice was rinsed at the
celebration of the mass. It was usually
placed within a niche, although the basin often projects
from the face of the wall, and is sometimes supported on
a shaft rising from the floor. In the Early English and
Decorated periods there are often two basins and two
drains, and occasionally three. Within the niche a
wooden or stone shelf is often found, called a credence-table,
on which the sacred
vessels were placed previous to
their being required at the altar.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Piscinas.</div>

<p class="noindent">Piscinas are unknown in
England of earlier date than
the middle of the 12th century,
and of that date they are
extremely rare. Of thirteenth
and succeeding centuries we
have many examples, more or
less mutilated. Their forms and
decorations are very various,
but the character of their architectural
features will always
decide their approximate date.<a name="img40" id="img40"></a></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">The Sedilia, from the Latin
<i>sedile</i>, a seat, has come to be
applied in modern times to the
seats used by the celebrants
during the pauses in the mass. <span class="sidenote">Sedilia.</span>They were sometimes
moveable, but more usually in this country
were formed of masonry and recessed
in the wall. They are generally three
in number, for the priest, deacon and sub-deacon, while
in a few rare instances they number four seats, as
at Rothwell Church, Northants, and Furness Abbey;
or even five, as at Southwell Minster. Sometimes
a long single seat under one arch is found, and
when three seats are used the two western ones are
often on the same level and the eastern one raised above
them. Numerous examples remain in our churches,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
some being as early as the latter part of the 12th century,
but they are mostly later and extend to the end of the
Perpendicular style. Some of them are separated by
shafts, and profusely ornamented with panelling,
niches, statues, pinnacles, tabernacle work, and crowned
with canopies all more or less elaborately enriched.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Stalls.</div>

<p class="noindent">Stalls are fixed seats in the choir, either wholly or
partially enclosed and used by the clergy. Previous to
the Reformation all large and many small
churches had a range of wooden stalls on
each side and at the west end of the choir.
In cathedrals they were enclosed at the back with panelling,
and surmounted by overhanging canopies of tabernacle
work, generally of oak, of which those at Winchester,
Henry VII.'s Chapel at Westminster, and
Manchester Cathedral are possibly our finest examples.
When the stalls occupied both sides of the choir, return
seats were placed at the ends for the prior, dean, precentor,
and other of the officiating clergy.<a name="Plate_4" id="Plate_4"></a></p>

<p>Mr. Parker, in his "<i>Glossary of Architecture</i>," gives
the following definition of the miserere, patience or
pretella. "The projecting bracket on the underside
of the seats of stalls in churches; these, when perfect,
are fixed with hinges so they may be turned up, and
when this is done the projection of the miserere is
sufficient, without actually forming a seat, to afford
very considerable rest to anyone leaning upon it. They
were allowed as a relief to the infirm during the long
services that were required to be performed by ecclesiastics
in a standing posture." It is in the carving of these
that one is frequently struck by the curious mixture
of the sacred and the profane, the refined and the vulgar,
for which it is difficult to find any adequate explanation.
Of so coarse a nature are some of these carvings that it
has been necessary to entirely remove them from the
stalls. They are usually attributed to the mendicant
and wandering monks, and they undoubtedly reflect the
licentiousness which at one time pervaded the monastic
and conventual establishments. Among our best examples
are those at Christchurch Priory, Hants, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
in Henry VII.'s Chapel. There is a remarkably complete
set in Exeter Cathedral.<a name="img41" id="img41"></a></p>

</div>

<p>Of modern pews it is not necessary to say anything
here, but previous to
the Reformation the
nave of a church was
usually fitted with
fixed seats, parted
from each other by
wainscoting, and
partially enclosed at
the ends by framed
panelling, but more
often by solid pieces
of wood, either
panelled or carved
on the front. These
bench-ends are very
common in the
West of England, in
Somerset and Devon,
and they are often
very beautiful pieces
of work and were
in all probability
executed by local
craftsmen. They
embrace a variety
of subjects: figures,
scrolls, dragons,
serpents, etc., and
frequently bear the
arms of the family
who owned the pew.
Sometimes they terminate
at the top
with finials either
in the form of heads, bunches of foliage, a chamfered
<i>fleur-de-lys</i> and a variety of other ornaments called
Poppy-heads, from the French <i>Poup&eacute;e</i>. No examples<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
are known to exist earlier than the Decorated style, but
of Perpendicular date specimens are very numerous,
especially in our cathedrals and old abbey churches.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Pulpits.</div>

<p class="noindent">Pulpits were formerly placed, not only in churches,
but in the refectories and occasionally in the cloisters of
monasteries, and there is one in the outer
court of Magdalen College, Oxford, and
another at Shrewsbury. In former times
pulpits were placed in the nave attached to a wall, pillar
or screen, usually against the second pier from the
chancel arch. Some are of wood, others of stone; the
former are mostly polygonal, with the panels enriched
with foliation or tracery. Few exist of earlier date
than the Perpendicular style, but stone pulpits of Decorated
date are sometimes met with as at Beaulieu, Hants,
a very early specimen. Wooden pulpits are usually
hexagonal or octagonal; some stand on slender wooden
stems, others on stone bases. A few have canopies
or sounding boards, and their dates can be fixed by the
character of their ornamentation. At Kenton, Devon,
there is an early pulpit which has retained its original
paintings. Jacobean pulpits are very numerous, and are
frequently gilded and painted; the one at S. Saviour's
Church, Dartmouth, being a most elaborate example.</p>

<p>Open-air preaching is anything but a modern invention,
for long before the erection of parish churches it
was the recognised method of addressing the people.
There is a print of some popular bishop preaching in
a pulpit at Paul's Cross in S. Paul's Churchyard, and in
medi&aelig;val days open-air pulpits were erected near the
roads, on bridges and often on the steps of the market
crosses, which are often still known as preaching
crosses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Squints.</div>

<p class="noindent">In some of our churches is to be seen a squint, an
opening in an oblique direction through a wall or pier for
the purpose of enabling persons in the aisles
or transepts to see the elevation of the
Host at the high altar. They are of
frequent occurrence in our churches and are very numerous
in the neighbourhood of Tenby, South Wales, also<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
in Devon
and the
West generally.<a name="img42" id="img42"></a></p>

</div>

<p>They
are usually
without any
ornament,
but are
sometimes
arched and
enriched
with tracery.
They
are mostly
found on
one or both
sides of the
chancel
arch, but
they sometimes
occur
in rooms
above porches,
in
side-chapels
and the like;
in every instance
they
were so situated
that
the altar
could be
seen. When
they occur
in porches
or the rooms
above they
are thought
to have been
for the use<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
of the acolyte appointed to ring the sanctus bell, who,
viewing the performance of mass, would be thus able to
sound the bell at the proper time. The name hagioscope
has been used to describe these oblique openings.</p>

<p>Cruciform marks are sometimes found on our churches,
often on a stone in the porch; they are usually incised
crosses or five dots in the form of a cross. They were,
presumably, cut by the bishop when the building was
consecrated, and are called consecration crosses.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Screens.</div>

<p class="noindent">The rood-screens, separating the chancel or choir
of a church from the nave, usually supported the great
Rood or Crucifix, not actually on the
screen itself, but on a beam called the
rood-beam, or by a gallery called the
rood-loft, which last was approached from the inside
of the church, by a small stone staircase in the wall,
as can be seen in many of our churches to-day. Although
rood-lofts have been generally destroyed in England,
some beautiful examples remain at Long Sutton, Barnwell,
Dunster and Minehead, Somerset; Kemsing,
Kent; Newark, Nottingham; Uffendon, Collumpton,
Dartmouth, Kenton, Plymtree and Hartland, Devon.
The general construction of wooden screens is
close panelling below, from which rise tall slender
balusters, or wooden mullions supporting tracery rich
with cornices and crestings, frequently painted and gilded.
The lower panels often depict saints and martyrs. From
the top of the screen certain parts of the services and the
lessons were read. They were occasionally close together
and glazed, as we see by a most beautiful example at
Charlton-on-Otmoor, in Oxfordshire. These screens,
many of which have been over-restored, are very common,
and in addition to those above mentioned, are found
at S. Mary's, Stamford, Ottery S. Mary, Chudleigh,
Bovey, and in nearly all the Devon parish churches.
At Dunstable a screen of Queen Mary's time separates
the vestry from the chancel.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>

<p>Of stone screens space will permit of only the briefest
mention. They were used in various situations, to
enclose tombs and to separate chapels, and occasionally the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
rood-screen was of stone. The oldest piece of screen work

panelled, as at S. Michael's, Oxford; Solihull, Warwickshire;

<h3>BELLS AND BELFRIES.</h3>

<p>The history of bells is lost in antiquity, and little
is known about them previous to the XVth
century. It is probable, however, that they were
used in India and China centuries before they reached
Europe.</p>

<p>Bells were used by the Romans for many secular
purposes, and although their use was sanctioned by
the Christian Church about 400 A.D., they were not
in general use in England until 650 A.D.</p>

<p>The earliest bells were hand bells, quadrangular in
shape, and made of thin plates of copper or iron riveted
together, and their abominable sound when struck
must have been one of their chief merits, as the early
bells were much used for the purpose of frightening
the devil and other evil spirits.</p>

<p>Our oldest bells are hand bells, S. Patrick's bell at
Belfast (1091) and S. Ninian's bell at Edinburgh, which
is probably of even earlier date. From 1550 to 1750
was the golden age of production for bells, more especially
so in Belgium and the Low Countries, where the bells
of the towers and belfries were rung to arouse the country
in times of danger and invasion. It is quite possible that
the bells used for secular and religious purposes were kept
distinct. Bells played a very important part in medi&aelig;val
life, and next to cannon were regarded as the chief city
guardians, for he who held the bells held the town, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the first thing done by the invader on taking a town
was to melt the bells and thus destroy the means of
communicating an alarm.</p>

<p>In England our old towns, being almost entirely constructed
of wood, were liable to periodic and devastating
conflagrations, which fact suggested to that genius,
William the Conqueror, the institution of Couvre-feu,
or in its more popular form, Curfew, which rang at
eight o'clock in the evening, when all lights were to be
extinguished. The ringing of curfew has survived in
many of our towns and villages to this day, but it is
doubtful if the custom has been continuous from its
first institution.</p>

<p>The secular use of the bell is, however, only incidental,
and it is in its connection with religious life that we are
now concerned, for all church history, church doctrine
and church custom and observances are set to bell music.
Bells in fact may be said to sum up the short span of
our mortal life, for the birthday, the wedding and the
funeral, are all welded to religion by the church bell.</p>

<p>Bells were used for ecclesiastical purposes in England
long before the erection of our parish churches, for
Bede, speaking of the death of S. Hilda, A.D. 680, says
that "one of the sisters in the distant monastery of
Hackness, thought she heard as she slept, the sound
of the bell which called them to prayers," and Turketul
gave to Croyland Abbey a great bell called Guthlac,
and afterwards six others which he called Bartholomew
and Betelin, Turketul and Tatwin, and Pega and Bega.</p>

<p>S. Dunstan gave bells to many of the churches in
Somerset, and he also seems to have introduced bell
ringing into the monasteries.</p>

<p>A few words may be of interest concerning the number
and purposes of these monastic bells, with which the
life of the monks must have been completely bound up.
The <i>Signum</i> woke up the whole community at day-break.
The <i>Squilla</i> announced the frugal meal in the
refectory; but for those working in the gardens, the
cloister-bell, or <i>Campanella</i>, was rung. The abbot's
<i>Cordon</i>, or handbell, summoned the brothers and novices<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
to their Superior; whilst the <i>Petasius</i> was used to call in
those working at a distance from the main building. At
bed-time the <i>Tiniolum</i> was sounded, and the <i>Noctula</i>
was rung at intervals throughout the night to call the
monks to watch and pray. The <i>Corrigiumcula</i> was the
scourging bell, while the sweet-toned <i>Nota</i>, a choir bell,
was rung at the consecration of the elements.</p>

<p>The use of the bell-tower was recognised in the ancient
Saxon law, which gave the title of thane to anyone who
had a church with a bell-tower on his estate, and two
of our most interesting Saxon churches, Brixworth
and Brigstock, both in Northamptonshire, have each a
semi-circular tower rising together with the bell-tower,
and forming a staircase to it.</p>

<p>One of the most beautiful campaniles or bell-towers
still standing is that at Evesham, in Worcestershire,
which is a good specimen of Perpendicular architecture.
It was built by Abbot Lichfield, the last abbot but one
of the abbey, and took six years in building, and was
not quite completed when the famous abbey, of which
it was a final ornament, was pulled down.</p>

<p>In addition to this example at Evesham, detached
bell-towers exist, or once existed, at Chichester, East
Dereham, Glastonbury Abbey, Bruton, in Somerset, and
in several other places.</p>

<p>Markland, in his <i>Remarks on Churches</i>, says: "The
great bell-tower which once formed part of the abbey
church of S. Edmundsbury was commenced about 1436.
From the year 1441 to 1500 legacies were still being
given towards the building. In 1461 an individual,
probably a benefactor, desired to be buried <i>in magno
ostio novi campanilis</i>."<a name="img45" id="img45"></a></p>

<span class="caption"><b>Bell Turret for 3 Bells.</b><br />

</div>
<p>In Protestant use church bells have been stripped
of much of the former superstition and symbolism.
They are no longer rung to announce the miracle of
transubstantiation; neither are they called upon as
of old for the purpose of scaring devils, demons, and
other evil spirits which formed so prominent a feature
in the faith of the early Christian communities. Closely
connected with the subject of bells and belfries are the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
bell-gables or bell-turrets, so frequently found at the
west ends of our smaller churches which have no towers.</p>

<p class="noindent">They usually contain but one
bell, but are sometimes found
with two, and at Radipole
Church, near Weymouth, the
bell-turret was originally
designed to carry three bells.
They are generally most
picturesque little features of
which a few may be of
Norman date, but by far the
greater number of them are
Early English, a style in
which they are frequently
found. In addition to these
bell-turrets at the western
ends of our churches one
sometimes finds a similar,
but smaller, erection at the
eastern end of the roof of the
nave, but used for a very
different purpose, for while
the bell at the western end
was rung to summon the
parishioners to service, that
at the eastern end, known
as the Sanctus or Mass-bell,
was rung on the elevation of the Host during the celebration
of mass; although usually placed on the apex
of the roof, this bell sometimes occupied a position in
the lantern or tower, or in a turret of larger dimensions.
In churches where no turret existed it was carried in
the hand, and such is now the prevailing practice on the
continent. The turret for the Sanctus bell still exists
at Barnstaple, Devon, and St. Peter Port, Guernsey.
The Sanctus bell was generally made of silver, and
occasionally a number of little bells were hung in the
middle of the church, and by means of a wheel they
were all made to ring at once.</p>

<h4><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a>CHAPTER X.</h4>

<h3>THE SPIRE; ITS ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT.</h3>

<p>Probably the most beautiful feature of a Gothic
church is the spire, raising its tapering form far
above the town or village and forming a prominent
landmark, denoting the location of the House
of God. Although found occasionally in other styles,
the spire is essentially Gothic, and one of the most
marked characteristics of this period. Spires are generally
of two kinds, those constructed of timber and
covered with slates, lead, tiles or shingles, and those
built of stone or brick. Examples of both kinds are very
numerous on the continent and in England, while shingle
spires are especially common in Sussex.</p>

<p>The spire is generally acknowledged to have originated
from the small pyramidal roof so frequently found on
Saxon and Norman towers. This gradually became
elongated, and the towers were sometimes gabled on
each side, as is the case with the remarkable Saxon church
at Sompting, Sussex. This shows us very clearly the
angles of the spire resting upon the apex of each
gable, so that the spire itself is set obliquely to the
square of the tower.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>

<p>Saxon and Norman spires are very rare in England,
Sompting being our best example of the former and
thoseon
the eastern transepts of Canterbury Cathedral of the
latter.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>Of
Early English spires we have, fortunately, some good
examples, among which are those at Oxford Cathedral,
Wilford and Wansted, in the same county, and a very
graceful one at Leighton Buzzard. These 13th century
spires are very common in France, as at Chartres and
S. Pierre, Caen.</p>

<p>Of fourteenth century, or Decorated, spires, we have
many examples, of which perhaps the best is the beautiful
spire of Salisbury Cathedral, although the equally fine
one at S. Mary's, Oxford, runs it close for premier position.
The triple group at Lichfield Cathedral belong to this
period, as do the spires of Ross, Heckington, Grantham, S.
Mary's, Newark, King's Sutton, Bloxham and Snettisham,
Norfolk. A peculiarity of the Salisbury spire is
that it never formed part of the original design of the
cathedral, being added seventy years later. It is the
loftiest spire in England&mdash;404 feet&mdash;about 40 ft. higher
than the cross of S. Paul's. It speaks well for the Gothic
builders that such a vast superstructure as this tower
and spire could be imposed upon walls and piers never
intended to bear it. At an early period it was found to
have deflected twenty-three inches from the perpendicular,
but there has been no sign of any further
movement. Barnack Church, in Northamptonshire, has
a curious spire showing the transition from Norman to
Early English.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the sides of a church spire are
slightly curved, so that they swell out a little in the centre.
This is called the entasis of the spire, and belongs to the
study of optics in architecture. Where the spire has no
entasis the same effect is produced by the introduction
of small projecting gables, bands of carving, or a little
coronal of pinnacles.</p>

<p>One of the most clearly marked differences between
English and continental spires is that the latter are
much shorter than the towers which support them, the
towers, as a rule, being twice as high as the
spires.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>

<p>In England, on the contrary, the spire is generally very<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
much loftier than the tower. At Shottesbrook, Berks,
and Ledbury, Herefordshire, the spires occupy as much
as three-fifths of the total elevation, and the usual rule
in England is for the tower to be a little less in height
than the spire.</p>

<p>The masons lavished an extraordinary amount of
care and skill on their spires. So much is this the case
that there is hardly a medi&aelig;val spire in the country
which can be called ill-designed or displeasing.</p>

<p>Church spires are very common in some counties and
very rare in others. There are, of course, exceptions,
but it is in the flat counties that spires are most frequent,
the most beautiful ones being found in Northamptonshire,
Leicestershire, Lincolnshire, Warwickshire, Staffordshire,
Nottinghamshire and Oxfordshire.</p>

<p>The top of the spire is usually capped with a weather
vane terminating in a cock. The custom of using a cock
as the flag of the vane is of very early date, for Wolfstan,
in his Life of S. Ethelwold, written towards the end of
the 10th century, speaks of one which surmounted Winchester
Cathedral. In the Bayeux Tapestry one is shown
on the gable of Westminster Abbey, and one of the early
Popes ordained that every church under the papal jurisdiction
should be surmounted by a cock as emblematical
of the sovereignty of the church over the whole world.</p>

<h3>STAINED GLASS.</h3>

<p>The use of coloured glass in the windows of buildings
devoted to religious purposes appears to have
been employed as early as the ninth century, but
no examples remain of anything like so old a date, and
we have only illuminated missals and primitive drawings
by members of the conventual bodies to guide us in
determining the earliest styles of coloured glazing. It
appears to have consisted of more or less primitive
representations of the human form, with strong black
lines to indicate the features and folds of the drapery.
The backgrounds were generally masses of deep blue
or red, and in the rare instances where landscapes were
introduced positive colours only appear to have been used.
Our oldest specimens in England are those in the choir
aisles of Canterbury Cathedral, which appear to be of
the 12th century, and it is thought that they are the
remains of the original glazing that was put in when
this part of the building was rebuilt after a fire in 1174.
The general design is composed of panels of various
forms, in which are depicted subjects from Holy Scripture,
with backgrounds of deep blue or red; the spaces between
the panels are filled with mosaic patterns in which
blue and red colours predominate, and the whole design
is framed in an elaborate border of leaves and scroll-work
in brilliant colours.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>Of thirteenth century windows we have some magnificent
examples&mdash;unfortunately few unmutilated&mdash;as at
York, where is the five-light lancet window situated in
the north end of the transept, known as the Five
Sisters of York. Of this date, also, are the large circular
window of Lincoln Cathedral, and the windows at
Chetwode, Bucks; Westwell, Kent; West Horsley,
Surrey; and Beckett's Crown, Canterbury.</p>

<p>A little later, in the Decorated period, we get the great
east window of York Cathedral, 75 ft. high and 32 ft.
broad; the east window of Gloucester Cathedral, 72 ft.
high and 38 ft. broad; and other fine windows at Tewkesbury
Abbey; Merton College, Oxford; Wroxhall Abbey,
Warwickshire; and the churches of Chartham, Kent;
Stanford, Leicestershire; Ashchurch, Glous.; Cranley,
Surrey; Norbury, Derbyshire, and others. Salisbury
Cathedral has retained portions, but very lovely portions,
of the glazing of its west windows, and enough is left
to show that it was little inferior to the great windows
of York and Gloucester. Carlisle Cathedral, too, has
preserved fragments of the original glass in the tracery
of the great east window, but the lower part of the
glazing is modern. Windows in the Decorated style
continued to be arranged in panels, with the spaces
between them filled with flowing patterns of foliage, in
which the vine and ivy leaves predominate. Single
figures are more common than in the previous style, and
when used are generally shown beneath a simple pediment
or canopy. In the early examples they only
occupy a portion of the window light, but later they are
found occupying nearly the whole of the surface and are
surmounted by large and elaborate canopies. Quarries
are much used in this style, sometimes quite plain, but
more often with leaves or rosettes painted on them in
black lines, or painted with the vine and ivy leaves so
arranged that they form a repeating pattern over the
whole window. At this period, too, heraldry began
to be employed in the decoration of the windows to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
which it is always an appropriate and artistic adjunct,
and many authentic and valuable examples of our
national heraldry have thus been preserved for posterity.</p>

<p>With the advent of the Perpendicular style the glazing
became more uniform in character, the glass was thinner
and lighter, the tints paler, and the whole effect more
brilliant and transparent. The paintings for the most
part consist of large figures under elaborate canopies,
frequently occupying an entire light, and in the patterns
and smaller decorations there is a greater freedom
of design, and the whole treatment is more harmonious
and artistic than in any other period. The use of heraldry
became very common, and inscriptions on long narrow
scrolls were frequently employed. Among the best
examples of this period are the windows at S. Margaret's
Church, Westminster; King's College Chapel, Cambridge;
Fairford Church, Gloucestershire; and Morley
Church, Derbyshire.</p>

<p>The Reformation, with its vast social and political
upheaval, was not conducive to the encouragement of
the fine arts, and from this period the art of glazing in
England declined beyond measure, and was not the only
art that received its death-blow in the triumph of
Puritanism. The art has, however, revived greatly
during recent years, thanks, among other artists, to
William Morris and Burne-Jones. A few words must
be said about the "Jesse" window found in some
of our cathedrals and churches. Strictly speaking,
it is a representation of the genealogy of Christ, in
which the different persons forming the descent are
placed on scrolls of foliage branching out of each
other, intended to represent a tree. It was also wrought
into a branched candlestick, thence called a Jesse,
a common piece of furniture in ancient churches.
The subject is found on a window at Llanrhaiadr y
Kinmerch, Denbighshire, on the stone work of one of
the chancel windows at Dorchester Church, Oxfordshire,
and in carved stone on the reredos of Christchurch
Priory, Hants.</p>

<p>It is not perhaps generally known that the actual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
colours used in early stained glass possessed each of
them their own specific symbolism. Underlying the
obvious story conveyed by the human figures or
decorated devices, there was an inner story to be read
with profit by those who understood the mystic symbolism
concerning colours. Without entering at length
into this interesting subject, it may yet be stated that
green was the symbol of Regeneration, red of Divine
Love, white of Divine Wisdom, yellow of Faith, and
grey, or a mixture of black and white, the emblem of
Terrestrial Death and Spiritual Immortality. These
colours at different times or in different countries had
other meanings as well, and ecclesiologists tell us that
the colours chosen for depicting the robes of our Lord
differ according to the period of His life which it was
intended to represent.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<h3>CRYPTS.</h3>

<p>The crypts so generally found beneath our cathedrals
and abbeys, and so frequently under our churches,
rarely extend beyond the choir or chancel and its
aisles, and are sometimes of very small dimensions.
They are often coeval with the upper parts of the building,
and although not so elaborate in ornamentation
as the fabric they support, they are almost without
exception well constructed and well finished pieces of
building. In some cases the crypt is of much older
date than any portion of the superstructure, as is the
case at York, Worcester and Rochester cathedrals.
During the twelfth and thirteenth centuries the roofs
were often richly groined, and upheld by cylindrical
columns or clustered piers, and furnished with handsome
bases and decorated capitals. There is abundant evidence
that crypts were at one time furnished with altars,
piscinas, and the various fittings requisite for the celebration
of the mass, and they were used as sepulchres,
wherein the shrines of relics and martyrs were carefully
preserved. Some authorities claim a purely Saxon
origin for the crypts at Ripon Cathedral, Hexham Abbey,
and Repton Church, Derbyshire. The Ripon example
is a plain barrel-vaulted chamber, about 11 ft. long and
8 ft. wide, with no pillars or ornament of any kind.
It is popularly known as S. Wilfrid's Needle, but the exact
origin of the name is lost in obscurity. The Hexham
crypt is very similar in character, but is somewhat longer,
being more than 13 ft. long and 8 ft. wide. As at Ripon,
there are hollows or shallow niches in the walls in which
lamps may possibly have been placed. The third reputed
Saxon crypt is that at Repton, but it has little in common
with the other two, its superficial area being nearly
twice as great and the roof is supported on four columns,
with plain square capitals rudely carved, and bearing
much similarity to early Norman work.</p>

<p>The position of the crypt varies. At Beverley Minster<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
it is on the south side of the south-west tower; in Hereford
Cathedral it is under a side chapel, while at Lastingham,
in Yorkshire, the crypt extends under the whole
of the church, including the apse. At Wells the crypt
is beneath the chapter-house, and Durham Cathedral
has three crypts, one under what was the dormitory,
another beneath the refectory, and the third under the
prior's chapel. Of crypts of Norman date we have many
examples, of which, perhaps, our best are those at
Gloucester, Worcester, Canterbury and Winchester
Cathedrals, while Canterbury is probably the largest
of them all. Good crypts are also found at Wimborne
Minster, Christchurch Priory, and in our smaller churches
at Repton and S. Peter's-in-the-East, Oxford.</p>

<p>The Wimborne crypt is lighted by four windows.
The vaulting is supported by two pairs of pillars which
form three aisles, each of three bays. Mr. Perkins, in
his book on Wimborne Minster, says, "On each side of
the place where the altar stood there are two openings
into the choir aisles. The exteriors of these are of the
same form and size as the crypt windows, but they
are deeply splayed inside, and probably were used as
hagioscopes or squints, to allow those kneeling in the
choir aisles to see the priest celebrating mass at the
crypt altar." The crypt at Christchurch is of Norman date,
and now serves as a vault for the Malmesbury family.
The crypt of Canterbury Cathedral is claimed and justly
claimed, perhaps, as the largest and most beautiful in
England. It is thought to contain fragments of Roman
and Saxon work, and much of it dates from the days of
S. Anselm (1096-1100). It was here that the remains
of S. Thomas &agrave; Becket lay from 1170 to 1220, and "here
that Henry II., fasting and discrowned, with naked feet,
bared back, and streaming tears, performed on July
12th, 1174, the memorable penance for his share in the
murder of the great Archbishop."</p>

<p>It was here too, in later times that the Walloons were

<h3>HOW TO DESCRIBE AN OLD CHURCH.</h3>

<p>Having carefully read the foregoing chapters, it
should be possible for anyone interested in the
subject to be able to write a fairly accurate
description of any old church. The record should, if
possible, be amplified with sketches or photographs.</p>

<p>In course of time, decay, neglect and restoration will
deprive our ancient buildings of every visible stone of
original work which they possess, and careful records
of this kind, written, photographed and sketched, may
be of the highest possible value to future generations
of historians and architects, long after the objects themselves
have ceased to exist. The work in itself is of
absorbing interest, and the more one studies these works
of past ages the stronger becomes the conviction that
our old buildings, whether cathedral, castle or simple
village church, are the landmarks of the nation's history,
and a priceless inheritance of beauty and art the conservation
of which is the duty of all generations.</p>

<p>The principal points to be noted are&mdash;1. The name of
the church. 2. Its situation. 3. Its dedication. 4.
General plan. 5. The style of architecture to which
each portion belongs. 6. Any peculiarity of the architecture,
blocked up windows, etc. 7. Any ancient<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
furniture, screens, bench-ends, glass. 8. Any monuments,
tablets, or mural paintings. 9. Church plate,
bells, registers. 10. Any local traditions. The record
should be made somewhat in the following manner.</p>

<p>The church of&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;is prettily situated on rising
ground some quarter of a mile north of the village, and
on the main road to&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;. It is approached by a picturesque
timber lych-gate, and consists of nave, aisles
and chancel, having a side chapel to the north and a
single transept to the south. At the west end is a Decorated
tower and spire. There are two porches, one on
the north side and the other on the west, which last
has a niche for a figure over the doorway and seats on
either side. The nave is Perpendicular, as is the greater
part of the rest of the fabric. Above the nave rises
a lofty and noble clerestory, divided from the aisles by
five rather obtusely-pointed arches supported by richly
moulded piers with small moulded capitals. Each
bay of the clerestory contains two three-light windows of
late Perpendicular date. The roof is flat pitched and is of
oak, the principals are adorned with panelled tracery
and show vestiges of ancient colour decoration. The
windows of the aisles are late Decorated in style; they
are of three lights, the traceries elegant and richly
moulded. The east window is Perpendicular and is
much sub-divided by mullions and transoms; in the
upper portions are some heraldic coats of arms, which
appear to have formed part of a much earlier window.
The chancel is divided from the nave by a fine open
oak screen, coeval with the larger part of the building.
It is richly carved and gilded, and in the right-hand side
of the chancel arch are the steps which formerly led up
to the top of it. The chancel, together with its chapel,
is vaulted in stone with well marked ribs and carved
bosses. The transept, late Perpendicular, opens into
the south side of the nave by a four-centred arch, and
has a rich flat ceiling. In the chancel is a piscina of
Early English date, together with a sedilia of the same
period. On the north side of the chancel, resting on the
floor, is a cross-legged effigy, in chain mail, surcoat, etc.,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
and bearing on his left arm a shield, but all much mutilated.
There is a local tradition that it represents
Sir&nbsp;<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>, but there is no evidence by which he can be
identified. Features of the church are the many highly
carved bench ends, all in oak, representing a great variety
of subjects, such as dragons, serpents, etc., while a few
bear the arms of local families who probably bore the
cost of the work. The pulpit is Jacobean, and has no
special feature. The font, which stands in the centre of
the nave, is square in form and is supported by a modern
round plinth. It is constructed of marble, the four sides
being carved in low relief with intersecting patterns. It
is possibly of Norman date, and is the only existing
feature of a much earlier church. The tower and spire
are Decorated; the latter is of stone with four pinnacles
at the base, and has a little coronal of pinnacles. The
belfry windows are arranged in pairs on each side of
the tower. The tower or western window is of five
lights, richly Decorated in style.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
